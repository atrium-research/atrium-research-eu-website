The goal of ATRIUM (Advancing fronTier Research In the arts and hUManities) is to bridge leading research infrastructures in arts and humanities ([DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/)), archaeology ([ARIADNE](https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu/)), languages ([CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/)), and open scholarly communication in the social sciences and humanities ([OPERAS](https://operas-eu.org/)).

The Arts and Humanities is a very diverse field, covering a range of disciplines and communities of practice that have different epistemological and methodological foundations: an archaeologist and an art historian studying a Mycenaean fresco will have distinct goals and approaches to describing their objects of research. A literary scholar and a linguist will come to a textual corpus with radically different senses of what a corpus is and what questions can be asked of it. Yet research infrastructures in the Arts and Humanities domain must cater to a very wide range of stakeholders and offer services that cut across discipline-specific boundaries.

ATRIUM will tackle this heterogeneity within the Arts and Humanities by going deep and wide at the same time: on the one hand, ATRIUM will make a groundbreaking contribution to the consolidation and expansion of services, including data services, specifically in the field of archaeology. On the other hand, ATRIUM facilitates access to a wide array of essential text, image and sound-based services that benefit a number of other disciplines within the Arts and Humanities, and cover all phases of the research data lifecycle (creating, processing, analyzing, preserving, providing access to and reusing).
