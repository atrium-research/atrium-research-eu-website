The First ATRIUM Mutual Learning Exercise (MLE) took place at the office of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) in Madrid on 29 April and gave service providers and data providers the opportunity to share knowledge and best practices on (meta)data management, enrichment, aggregation and interoperability.

The first ATRIUM MLE will be focused on GoTriple, a service offered by OPERAS Research Infrastructure that is also part of the ATRIUM Service Catalogue. The MLE will be organised by ATRIUM in partnership with FECYT, which leads OPERAS-ES, the Spanish Node of OPERAS.

## About GoTriple

GoTriple is an innovative multilingual discovery platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). It provides one single access point for discovering more than 19 million publications, 25 thousand projects and 22 million authors from the wide variety of disciplines under the umbrella domain of SSH. At its heart, GoTriple has a search engine whose indexes are fed by a configurable harvesting and processing pipeline that continuously imports and processes metadata for publications and projects from multiple sources (about 1,400), including large aggregators (BASE, DOAJ, OpenAire, Isidore) and national repositories alike (Hrƒçak, Biblioteka Nauki, ZRC Sazu, EKT, RECYT or Pombaline).
