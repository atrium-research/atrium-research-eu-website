## **Curriculum**

This intensive course will teach you to tidy your data as well as perform basic analysis with descriptive statistics and scientific visualisation techniques. It is a[ condensed version of a regular semestral course in R programming for humanities](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/r-for-humanities/lecture-notes) students who do not have any programming skills, boasting a non-competitive and highly supportive environment for scholars who get easily intimidated by computers.

Your goal is to gain a critical level of skill to prepare your own (tabular) data for further analysis - be it statistical modelling or visualization. You will learn how to structure your data to get exactly the information you want, including a working proficiency in scientific visualization. This two-week course will take place over ten teaching days, scheduling a morning and an afternoon block, which will be interrupted by an ample time slot for lunch and recuperation. Typically, there will be one 90-minute lecture in the morning and one in the afternoon. Other sessions are composed as either 90-minute self-paced study slots in [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) or a small individual/pair/group project. Either way, the teacher will be on standby in the room. You will work with RStudio. You do not even have to install it for the course since we will provide you with access to our cloud installation to use in your web browser. Please bring your own laptop and your own headphones. The headphones are very important since you will be watching DataCamp video tutorials individually.
