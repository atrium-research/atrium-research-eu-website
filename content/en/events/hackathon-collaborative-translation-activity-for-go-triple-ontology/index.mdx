The GoTriple Ontology Translation Hackathon is a collaborative translation initiative aimed at refining the linguistic accuracy of the GoTriple ontology, while testing the platform ***Mondaecus***. The activity focuses on translating the ontology—originally in English—into the official languages of GoTriple: **Italian**, **French**, **German**, **Polish**, **Portuguese**, **Croatian**, **Slovenian**, **Finnish** and **Spanish**. Additionally, the initiative will explore the inclusion of at least one non-official language, such as Norwegian, Dutch and Czech, reflecting GoTriple’s openness to future linguistic expansions.



This hackathon combines translation with a collective review by experts in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), proficient users, and native speakers of the respective languages to ensure terminological precision, cultural appropriateness, and linguistic authenticity.
