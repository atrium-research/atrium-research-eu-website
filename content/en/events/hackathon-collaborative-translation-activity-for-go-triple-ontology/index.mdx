 The GoTriple Ontology Translation Hackathon is a collaborative initiative focused on reviewing and refining the multilingual structure of the GoTriple ontology. It also serves as a real-world test case for Mondaecus, a collaborative translation platform developed to support scientific multilingualism and collective translation workflows. The activity will focus on reviewing ontology translations from English into a selection of languages (Italian, French, German, Polish, Portuguese, Croatian, Slovenian, Finnish, and Spanish), and explore the inclusion of new languages such as Dutch, Norwegian, Czech, and Serbian. The hackathon also serves as a testbed for <Link link={{"discriminant":"external","value":"https://mondaecus.com/"}}>the MONDAECUS platform</Link>, which enables participants to work collaboratively on translations in real time, suggesting edits, exchanging comments, and validating outputs. Feedback from this activity will be used to refine the platform’s features in future iterations.&#x20;

This is a pilot initiative that explores the value of human collaboration in enhancing machine-assisted translations, particularly in specialized domains such as Social Sciences and Humanities. Participation is by invitation. However, if you are interested in contributing, please contact the ATRIUM coordination team (or the Hackathon organization team): info\@atrium-research.eu&#x20;
