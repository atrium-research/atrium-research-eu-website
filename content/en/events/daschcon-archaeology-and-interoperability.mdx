**DaSCHCon:** **Archaeology & Interoperability**

ATRIUM has the pleasure to be presented at the [DaSCHCon 2024](https://www.dasch.swiss/post/daschcon-2024-on-archaeology-interoperability), dedicated to exploring data interoperability and data quality in archaeology.

Émilie Pagé-Perron, from the University of York, will present how the [ARIADNE Portal](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu) is at the heart of the ATRIUM project.&#x20;

The ARIADNE portal, a Linked Open Data powered metadata aggregation platform, is the fruit of 12 years of development, part of the ARIADNE research infrastructure. Through its accessible portal which includes a search engine, map and timeline tools, and powerful filters, researchers and an interested public can discover archaeology-related datasets based on different classification criteria.

Through the ATRIUM project, the ARIADNE knowledge graph will enable further interoperability in archaeological research. As the project will produce workflows that address challenges regarding text, image, 3D, sound, and geospatial data, the portal will be extended to accommodate the discoverability of the related datasets. In practice, users will profit from enriched metadata, greatly increasing the discoverability of the resources concerned, and the possibility of further direct interaction with distant datasets, for example through a IIIF viewer displaying images from various providers side by side.
