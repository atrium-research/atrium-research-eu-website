This full-day workshop at the DHd 2026 Conference 2026 is dedicated to research workflows and their reusability, providing an actionable contribution to the question of knowledge production addressed in the call for papers. In particular, we strive to foster community building around the recognition of the heuristic value of digital-based methodologies.

The workshop is a combination of a training event and a collaborative form of work on the topic of research reproducibility and workflows. The workshop is directed at a wide audience, comprising researchers, technicians, and more generally people involved in research and infrastructure, with a specific focus on open science, interoperability and research reproducibility. Participants are limited to 15 people, each should bring their own computers and have access to the internet.
