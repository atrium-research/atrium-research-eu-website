ATRIUM has the pleasure of being presented at the Open Science Conference 2025.&#x20;

The [Open Science Conference](https://www.open-science-conference.eu) is an annual international conference dedicated to the Open Science movement. It provides a unique forum for researchers, data stewards, librarians, practitioners, infrastructure providers, policy makers, and other important stakeholders to discuss the latest and future developments in Open Science. In 2025, the conference returns to its roots and takes place as a face-to-face event in Hamburg again.

Fran√ßoise Gouzi, Francesco Gelati, Anne Baillot and Toma Tasovac will present 'Enhancing transparency and reusability through Diamond publishing model: *Transformations, A DARIAH Journal*', focusing on how *Transformations* adopts the ATRIUM Peer Review Framework to adopt open peer-review processes.&#x20;
