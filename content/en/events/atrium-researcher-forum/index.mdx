The ATRIUM Researcher Forum aims at fostering closer interactions between researchers active in and around research infrastructures with both service and data providers. The goal is to ensure a better understanding of the researchersâ€™ needs, but also to establish relations that facilitate the improvement of the services. The research community is seen as an innovative community that should be engaged in the development of solutions. The Researcher Forum stimulates two-way communication as the prerequisite for long-term efficient interactions.&#x20;

Participants are invited to participate in the Usability testing of the GoTriple platform as well as to join an expert focus group and panel discussion to help us improve the GoTriple platform.
