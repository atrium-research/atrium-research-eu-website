Learn the basics of automatic handwriting recognition, become proficient in the eScriptorium tool, and contribute to the creation of a training dataset now integrated into the HTR-United platform. Hosted by INRIA, the transcribathon spanned three days and was organized by Biblissima+ with the support of the ATRIUM project through the TNA Summer Schools.&#x20;
