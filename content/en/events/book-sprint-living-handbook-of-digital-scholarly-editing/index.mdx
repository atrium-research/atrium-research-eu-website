Digital scholarly editions open up new possibilities for the accessibility, analysis, and reuse of cultural texts. However, researchers who wish to realise such an edition themselves are confronted with complex conceptual, technical, and legal decisions. The event takes up these challenges: during a three-day book sprint, established experts collaboratively write a structured, practice-oriented guide covering all stages of creating a digital scholarly edition. It will be published as a living handbook.

**Organized by:** Anne Baillot (DARIAH/ATRIUM), Julie Giovacchini (CNRS-ENS-PSL), Mareike König (German Historical Institute Paris), and in cooperation with Lambert Heller ((Open Science Lab, TIB Hannover)

**With financial support from:** DARIAH/ATRIUM, [German Historical Institute Paris](https://www.dhi-paris.fr/de/home.html) and Observatoire des Humanités Numériques de PSL
