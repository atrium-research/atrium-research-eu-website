Automatic Text Recognition (ATR) has become key to unlocking information from scanned documents containing text and is now used in Cultural Heritage Research worldwide. The ATRIUM ATR Summer School brings together Digital Humanities practitioners willing to improve their Automatic Text Recognition pipeline. With a focus on novel methodologies, complex workflows and Open Science implementation, it is a unique opportunity for participants to take advantage of the expertise of the international trainer team to strengthen and level up their ATR project. DARIAH will host the summer school at Centre Marc Bloch, Friedrichstraße 191, 10117 Berlin.&#x20;

From the beginning of March 2025, the preliminary program and the call for participation will be available and the application process will be open until April 1st, 2025. The application results will be communicated by the beginning of May.
