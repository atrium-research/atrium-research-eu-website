From Maps to Data and Data to Maps: Exploring Spatial Histories - ATRIUM Summer School 2026

This summer school, hosted at the Athens University of Economics & Business, is designed for scholars and professionals interested in exploring digital humanities methods for mapping and spatial visualization. Mapping in the digital humanities provides new perspectives on sources, enables analysis in a spatial context, and offers visual representations of arguments and narratives. Participants will be introduced to key topics, including spatial data collection, geocoding, georeferencing, map annotation, data wrangling, and different types of maps, platforms, and hosting services.

The summer school is open to scholars from all disciplines, regardless of technical background. Experience with mapping, GIS methods, tools, and concepts is welcome but not required. This summer school will be of particular interest to those in History, Archaeology, Urban Studies, Architecture, Cultural Studies, Public Humanities, and Photography. Knowledge of Greek is not required.

The deadline for applications is 9th March.
