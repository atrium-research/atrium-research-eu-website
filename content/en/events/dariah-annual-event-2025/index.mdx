The DARIAH Annual Event 2025 will be dedicated to the topic of **The Past**. We are looking for contributions that leverage Digital Humanities approaches to analyse, interpret, and present historical and archaeological data. Whether through digital methods, workflows, archives, computational analysis, interactive media, or other digital means, we seek to highlight innovative approaches to studying the past.

The Annual Event will be held in person in Göttingen, Germany, June 17-20. The event will be hosted by the [Göttingen State and University Library (SUB Göttingen)](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/news/). June 17th will be a day for DARIAH internal meetings, followed by the conference on June 18th to June 20th. Accepted submissions are expected to be presented in-person. [**The call for papers is now open.**](https://www.conftool.net/dariah2025/)
