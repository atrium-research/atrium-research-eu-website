The 2nd ATRIUM Researcher Forum focused on the CLARIN [Transcription Portal ](https://speechandtech.eu/transcription-portal). The event took place on **November 25, 2025**, at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). You can read the summary of the event [here.](https://atrium-research.eu/news/2nd-atrium-researcher-forum-valuable-user-feedback-and-expert-advice-for-the-clarin-transcription-portal/) It followed the [first edition held in Poznań](https://atrium-research.eu/news/atrium-first-researcher-forum/), Poland, in 2024, working on OPERAS [GoTriple platform](https://gotriple.eu/).

The ATRIUM Researcher Forum aims at fostering closer interactions between researchers active in and around research infrastructures with service providers. The event is twofold: users are invited to perform a usability test and help improve the service, while experts are gathered to discuss current features and possible new developments.

The Transcription Portal is an easy-to-use web service that scholars from any domain can use to transcribe, summarise, and translate audio files produced in Dutch, German, Italian, and English. The service is hosted by LMU in München and made discoverable through the [CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/), one of the ATRIUM Services.
