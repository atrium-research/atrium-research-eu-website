The SSH Open Marketplace – [marketplace.sshopencloud.eu](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu) – is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows. As one of the core DARIAH services, flagship of the SSHOC Cluster, the [SSH Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu) is used to document research workflows ([see existing workflows](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/search?categories=workflow)).

The workshop is co-organised by the [SSH Open Marketplace Editorial Team](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/about/team) and the ATRIUM project and co-located at the DARIAH Annual Event 2024, which has the theme "Workflows: Digital Methods for Reproducible Research Practices in the Arts and Humanities". The aim is to present the SSH Open Marketplace discovery service and bring participants to use it to index and document the resources and digital methods used in their research. In the ATRIUM context, participants in the workshop will discuss resources featured in the project's[ tools & services catalogue](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/search?f.keyword=ATRIUM+catalogue). They will collaboratively create or enhance entries for these resources in the SSH Open Marketplace. This effort serves as a foundational step for developing ATRIUM workflows in the Marketplace, and there's potential to expand the discussion to include other resource types, such as semantic artefacts. This workshop will be structured in two main sessions:

1. A morning session, open to all, will provide all the basics needed to become a contributor and a creator of workflows in the SSH Open Marketplace.
2. An afternoon session, dedicated to the ATRIUM project members, aiming at enriching (or creating) the ATRIUM catalogue resources in the SSH Open Marketplace.
