ATRIUM has the pleasure to again host a session at the annual CAA conference, this time at <Link link={{"discriminant":"external"}}>[CAA2026](https://2026.caaconference.org)</Link> in Vienna, Austria, with the theme 'It's all about people'.&#x20;

ATRIUM will present **Session 38** **End-to-End Reusable Archaeological Data Workflows: Spotlight on the Demonstrator Model**, co-organised by [The Archaeology Data Service](%5Bhttps://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/%5D\(https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/\)) and the research infrastructure [ARIADNE](https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu) and chaired by Émilie Pagé-Perron (ADS), Marco Callieri (CNR) & Julian Richards (ADS).&#x20;

The goal of the session is to showcase this demonstrator model, exploring the current status and trends of FAIR workflows, tools, and infrastructures. By showcasing existing demonstrators of such research workflows and comparing the outcomes of case studies, this session aims to foster dialogue & best practices, and reflect on issues and facilitators for sustainable data reuse.

Calls for papers are open until 26th October, with more information found [here](https://www.atrium-research.eu/news/caa-2026-call-for-papers/).
