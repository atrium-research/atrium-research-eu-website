The [CLARIN Annual Conference](https://www.clarin.eu/event/2025/clarin-annual-conference-2025) is the annual event for those working on the construction and operation of CLARIN across Europe. It is organised for the wider humanities and social sciences communities in order to exchange ideas and experiences within the CLARIN infrastructure. This includes the design, construction and operation of the CLARIN infrastructure, the data, tools and services that it contains or for which there is a need, its actual use by researchers and teachers, its relation to other infrastructures and projects, and the CLARIN Knowledge Infrastructure.

ATRIUM had the pleasure of being presented twice at the CLARIN Annual Conference 2025 with the **poster 'MetaCat suite: Towards a systematic analysis of catalogues'** as well as the **presentation 'State of the Technical Infrastructure'.**

### *MetaCat suite – Towards a Systematic Analysis of Catalogues* Abstract

*Authors: Massimiliano Carloni, Matej Ďurčo, Vera Maria Charvát, Twan Goosen, Julien Homo, Antoine Isaac, Michael Kurzmeier, Alessia Bardi*

One of the central objectives of the ATRIUM project is to improve the discoverability of resources in the arts and humanities by aligning metadata curation and enrichment workflows between major data catalogues in the domain (ARIADNE Knowledge Base, CLARIN VLO, GoTriple, SSH Open Marketplace). Towards this end, the ATRIUM team is developing MetaCat, a suite comprising a systematic, high-level, machine-readable overview of the data represented in the catalogues, together with the semantic artefacts used, accompanied by tooling that allows interactive exploration, analysis and comparison of this information.

## **Presentation 'State of the Technical Infrastructure'**

*Author: Dieter Van Uytvanck*

This presentation presented the WP6 'Service Interoperability and EOSC Integration' work on the Digital Object Gateway (DOG).&#x20;

Digital Object Gateway is an abstraction layer for accessing Digital Objects that are referred to with a Persistent Identifier ( ) or URL. The end user of DOG does not need to know the specifics of how to access one particular data repository. Instead, by sending the identifier of an object (typically the landing page) to the DOG, the DOG can perform a range of standard operations to explore and process the object.
