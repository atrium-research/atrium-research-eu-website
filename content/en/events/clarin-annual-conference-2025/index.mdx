The CLARIN Annual Conference is the annual event for those working on the construction and operation of CLARIN across Europe. It is organised for the wider humanities and social sciences communities in order to exchange ideas and experiences within the CLARIN infrastructure. This includes the design, construction and operation of the CLARIN infrastructure, the data, tools and services that it contains or for which there is a need, its actual use by researchers and teachers, its relation to other infrastructures and projects, and the CLARIN Knowledge Infrastructure.

ATRIUM will present the poster *MetaCat suite - Towards a Systematic Analysis of Catalogues* Authors: Massimiliano Carloni, Matej Ďurčo, Vera Maria Charvát, Twan Goosen, Julien Homo, Antoine Isaac, Michael Kurzmeier, Alessia Bardi

### *MetaCat suite – Towards a Systematic Analysis of Catalogues* Abstract

One of the central objectives of the ATRIUM project is to improve the discoverability of resources in the arts and humanities by aligning metadata curation and enrichment workflows between major data catalogues in the domain (ARIADNE Knowledge Base, CLARIN VLO, GoTriple, SSH Open Marketplace). Towards this end, the ATRIUM team is developing MetaCat, a suite comprising a systematic, high-level, machine-readable overview of the data represented in the catalogues, together with the semantic artefacts used, accompanied by tooling that allows interactive exploration, analysis and comparison of this information.
