ATRIUM had the pleasure to be presented at DHNB 2025 ‘Digital Dreams and Practices’ by Iulianna van der Lek (CLARIN), focusing on the upcoming ATRIUM summer school opportunities.&#x20;

This year's DHNB delved into the synergy between dreams in digital humanities and their practical applications, seeking to maximize value for both academia and society at large. The focus sharpens on the transformative potential of AI, its integration with traditional humanities, and its role in transcending academic boundaries. Scholars, practitioners, and societal stakeholders were invited to explore the following:

(1) the integration of traditional humanities scholarship with computational techniques;

(2) the transition of digital humanities research from the ‘ivory tower’ of academic theory to societal practice;

(3) the practical applications of Artificial Intelligence.
