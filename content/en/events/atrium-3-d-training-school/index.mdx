Join us for an intensive one-week summer school at the Institute of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, where you will learn how to create 3D models of archaeological artefacts and historic monuments through photogrammetry and laser scanning, as well as how to process and manage them. The technologies for 3D documentation are becoming increasingly prevalent in archaeological research and monument protection. These techniques not only serve to preserve archaeological heritage in the form of a digital twin, they are also very well suited for example for popularisation purposes. Our schedule combines engaging theoretical lectures with practical workshops, ensuring you gain both essential knowledge and real-world experience. We are excited to assist you in mastering cutting-edge techniques that will enhance your archaeological research and practice! The summer school is ideal for beginners, offering introductory courses and hands-on learning opportunities to help participants gain confidence in the subject.

The training school is part of a trans-national access scheme provided by the [ATRIUM Project](https://atrium-research.eu/), hosted by the [Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR)](https://aiscr.cz/) research infrastructure at the [Institute of Archaeology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno](https://arub.cz/).
