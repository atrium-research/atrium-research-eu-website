The European Summer University in Digital Humanities 'Culture and Technology' hosted an ATRIUM session titled "Bridging Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage: Key Insights from CLARIN, ATRIUM, and ECHOES." The session featured an online presentation on "Key Insights from the ATRIUM Researchers Survey," sharing findings from the project's comprehensive assessment of researcher needs and practices across the arts and humanities. This two-week intensive program brings together digital humanities scholars, and ATRIUM's participation reinforced connections between infrastructure development and scholarly practice.
