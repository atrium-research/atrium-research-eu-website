On the evening of Tuesday, 6 May, the ATRIUM and ARIADNE teams hosted a vibrant social event at Warehouse Assemblage in the heart of Athens. Starting at 20:00, the gathering brought together over 60 participants, including speakers from the ATRIUM panel discussion on 7th May at CAA2025, team members from both projects, and colleagues from across the CAA2025 community.

It was a fantastic opportunity to connect, share ideas, and build new collaborations in a relaxed setting. Many to ARIADNE for hosting, and especially to Claudio Prandoni for the excellent organisation and Brayan Padilla for the beautiful photography!&#x20;
