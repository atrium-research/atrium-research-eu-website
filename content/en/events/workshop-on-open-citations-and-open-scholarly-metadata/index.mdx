ATRIUM had the pleasure to be presented at the 5th Workshop on Open Citations and Open Scholarly Metadata (<Link link={{"discriminant":"external","value":"https://barcelona-declaration.org/conference_2025_bologna/"}}>WOOC2025</Link>) co-organised by the Barcelona Declaration, the University of Bologna and OpenCitations.

Alessandro Bertozzi and Luca De Santis from Net7 presented '**Boosting data interoperability of GoTriple.eu: Ontology alignment in the ATRIUM project**'. GoTriple is the multilingual discovery platform for the SSH domain, which supports researchers finding publications, projects, authors and researchers profiles in 10 different languages. In the context of ATRIUM, Net7 contributes to the development of GoTriple by completing and enriching the TRIPLE Ontology. &#x20;
