All researchers are welcome to this webinar jointly organised by two European projects:[ Skills4EOSC](https://www.skills4eosc.eu/), which aims to create a network of competence centres to speed up the training of European researchers for scientific data management, and the [ATRIUM Project](https://atrium-research.eu/), which bridges leading research infrastructures across Europe to improve data services, tools, and resources in digital humanities and archaeology. 

This session will outline the methodology for FAIR-by-design production of learning materials. Hosted by Sonja Filiposka (see bio below) the webinar will demonstrate a key six-stage workflow for ensuring training materials adhere to FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.

This webinar is ideal for researchers who want to learn more about best practices and tools for the development of FAIR learning materials, use definitions of metadata schemas for training materials, improve the quality and impact of their learning resources, and publish in relevant repositories and training catalogues.

It will take place on Friday 14th March from 10-12:30 CET via Zoom.

The Skills4EOSC Project - Skills for the European Open Science Commons: Creating a Training Ecosystem for Open and FAIR Science - has developed a methodology for FAIR-by-design learning materials that will ensure maximum reusability of developed learning materials within the community, and with that higher-quality materials.

The proposed methodology builds on the previous work done in other EOSC projects, while incorporating best practices and lessons learnt from related activities such as implementation of learning platforms, development of self-paced courses, definitions of metadata schemas for training materials and integration of training catalogues. All necessary steps to ensure the production of FAIR-by-design learning materials are outlined in a six-stage workflow that extends the traditional instructional design process with additional activities aiming to incorporate the FAIR principles.

#### Bio:

Prof. Sonja Filiposka is a full professor at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI), Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, with a PhD in Technical Sciences. A dedicated advocate for Open Science, she serves as the national EOSC promoter and heads the University Open Science Centre. With over a decade of experience in Open Science and EOSC research projects, she is a seasoned trainer and regional training organiser. Within Skills4EOSC she is the task leader of the FAIR-by-Design methodology for training materials.
