ATRIUM is delighted to be hosting a session at the upcoming [TAG conference](https://tag2025.hosted.york.ac.uk/en/) at the University of York. This year’s TAG theme is ‘theory in action’, encouraging us to ask questions such as how can we challenge systems of power and oppression and promote care, compassion, and social justice together? How can we celebrate our diverse communities and contributions to interpreting our shared pasts? Theory in action pushes us to take this step, to think about action and to perform our theories.

Anne Baillot and Émilie Pagé-Perron will explore these questions through the ATRIUM session '**Towards adaptation: environmental sustainability in archeological workflows'.** This session will focus on how humanities disciplines generally minimize the environmental impact of their activities by comparing them with natural sciences fields that rely on equipment or heavy computing. By doing so, they discard the systemic character of the environmental impact of scientific activities – the first issue tackled in this session. To what extent should scientists concern themselves with the environmental footprint of their research activities? Can this lead to epistemological shifts?

Our session 'Towards Adaptation: Environmental sustainability in Archaeological Workflows' will be on Wednesday, December 17, and will be held at the Theatre, Film & Television Building (Heslington East), 1st Floor, room 111.
