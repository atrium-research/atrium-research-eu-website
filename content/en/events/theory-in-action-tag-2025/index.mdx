ATRIUM is delighted to be hosting a session at the upcoming [TAG conference](https://tag2025.hosted.york.ac.uk/en/) at the University of York. This year’s TAG theme is ‘theory in action’, encouraging us to ask questions such as how can we challenge systems of power and oppression and promote care, compassion, and social justice together? How can we celebrate our diverse communities and contributions to interpreting our shared pasts? Theory in action pushes us to take this step, to think about action and to perform our theories.

Anne Baillot and Émilie Pagé-Perron will explore these questions through the ATRIUM session '**Towards adaptation: environmental sustainability in archeological workflows'.** This session will focus on how humanities disciplines generally minimize the environmental impact of their activities by comparing them with natural sciences fields that rely on equipment or heavy computing. By doing so, they discard the systemic character of the environmental impact of scientific activities – the first issue tackled in this session. To what extent should scientists concern themselves with the environmental footprint of their research activities? Can this lead to epistemological shifts?

Secondly, when it comes to Archeology, the importance of fieldwork (involving carbon-emitting travel) and the reliance on digital technologies (e.g., for 3D reconstruction or to archive digital surrogates) make it a research area prone to higher emissions than other Humanities disciplines. Which archaeological activities impact the environment, and how could emissions and effects on local biodiversity/water resources be considered in the conception of research settings?

Finally, one way to reduce the environmental footprint of a project is to make it reusable. Sharing resources and infrastructures is key to moving towards a more resource-saving way of conducting archeological research. In fact, not everything can be preserved, and the choices in what is made reusable are likely to shape the cultural canon. It requires us to interrogate our own colonial biases, which the technological dimension also emphasizes: while relying on open science tools and FAIR data favors their accessibility and reuse, they suppose a digital literacy that is, in turn, anything but universal. The session will close with the question: to what extent do digital technologies truly facilitate a sustainable approach to Archeology?

A call for papers for the session will be announced shortly.&#x20;
