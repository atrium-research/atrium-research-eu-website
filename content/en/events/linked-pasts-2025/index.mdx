The annual [Linked Pasts](https://linkedpasts.hcommons.org) – which has previously been held at KCL, Madrid, Stanford, Mainz, Bordeaux, University of London and British Library, Ghent, York and Tokyo—brings together scholars, heritage professionals and other practitioners with an interest in Linked Open Data as applied to the study of historical disciplines. Panels and working groups at Linked Pasts are more goal-oriented than a conventional academic conference, and activities and agendas are often proposed, developed and revised by all participants at the event itself.

To find out more and to sign up to one (or more) of the working groups, visit the event [website here.]([https://linkedpasts.hcommons.org/2025/11/09/linked-pasts-11-programme/]\(https://linkedpasts.hcommons.org/2025/11/09/linked-pasts-11-programme/\))&#x20;

## **Call for activities**&#x20;

Deadline: 2 November 2025

In 2025 Linked Pasts (“LP11”) will be an entirely online and largely asynchronous set of activities, run in a variety of formats and venues, from online meetings to lists, shared documents or code repositories.

We invite convenors of activities to send details of their plans and arrangements, which will be added to the LP11 programme so that Linked Pasts and Pelagios Network community members are encouraged to sign up to them. Proposed activities may be part of a larger project or collaboration (e.g. a PN Activity), but a significantly freestanding agenda and outcome should be planned for the time of or around the asynchronous symposium in December 2025.

Please include in your proposal (on one side of A4/Letter):

1. The title of the activity
2. The convenors of the activity
3. A short description (200–300 words) of the goals of the activity, how and when meetings or collaboration will be arranged, planned outputs of this activity.
4. How participants can sign up to the activity
5. Where to find out more about this activity, where future programme information and outputs will appear.
6. Confirm that convenors will write a short report on the activity after the symposium.

Please send your proposals to [gabriel.bodard\[at\]sas.ac.uk](mailto:gabriel.bodard@sas.ac.uk) by the end of day (in your timezone) **November 2, 2025**, and the programme will be announced as soon as possible thereafter.
