In our continued commitment to strengthening digital research infrastructures, the ATRIUM project recently hosted a dedicated one-day **FitSM Foundation** training course. This training, delivered by an accredited expert trainer from Sy Holsinger, OPERAS CTO, provided 13 participants with a comprehensive introduction to lightweight IT service management (ITSM) tailored for the research and academic context.

FitSM, a standard born from the EU-funded FedSM project (FP7, 2012–2015) and maintained by the non-profit ITEMO, offers a streamlined, accessible approach to service management. Designed to support federated and multi-organisational environments, it provides a common language for describing and managing services, and its open Creative Commons license makes both the standard and its training materials freely available to all.

Held online on Tuesday 13th May (9:00–17:30 CET), the training covered the core components of the FitSM standard, which include 14 key ITSM processes such as Service Portfolio Management, Incident Management, Change Management, and Continual Service Improvement. The course emphasized practical implementation and applicability, enabling participants to understand how to apply these principles within distributed research service settings.

The training concluded with the **FitSM Foundation certification exam**, administered as part of the course and formally recognised by APMG International, an external certification body. Congrats to those who passed the exam and achieved certification!

Many thanks to Sy Holsinger for the training and Carol Delmazo for the coordination!
