ATRIUM hosted a workshop at the Lorentz Center titled "From Recognition to Understanding: Framing Named Entity Recognition for Enriching Cultural Heritage with LLMs and Linked Open Data." This hands-on workshop explored cutting-edge approaches to enhancing cultural heritage data through the integration of large language models and linked open data principles. Participants learned how automated entity recognition and linking can transform how we discover, understand, and connect information across digital heritage collections. The workshop aligned with ATRIUM's goals of improving metadata quality and interoperability across research infrastructures.
