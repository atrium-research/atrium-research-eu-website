ARIADNE Research Infrastructure took part in the 2025 edition of tourismA, the annual exhibition dedicated to archaeology and cultural communication, held from 21 to 23 February in the prestigious Palazzo dei Congressi in the heart of Florence.

Since 2015, tourismA has served as a key event for sharing and promoting initiatives related to the dissemination and enhancement of ancient heritage.

With over 13,000 visitors, 350 speakers, 50 conferences, 3 exhibitions, 3 “archeo-tastings”, 100 exhibition booths, and 60 book presentations, this year’s edition reaffirmed its status as a major platform for dialogue among professionals, researchers, and the general public engaged in the fields of archaeology, art history, museums, and cultural heritage.

ARIADNE RI was present with a dedicated stand, offering visibility to its infrastructure, ongoing projects, and particularly its European collaborations. The booth featured promotional videos of both Ariadne RI and the ATRIUM project (Introducing ATRIUM: Advancing Frontier Research in the Arts & Humanities), as well as printed flyers in Italian, helping visitors better understand the objectives and impact of the research infrastructure.

Ariadne RI also contributed to the conference “*Museums and Libraries: Ongoing Efforts for Accessibility*”, curated by Prisma Cultura, which took place on Saturday 22 February, from 11:30 to 13:30, in the Sala Onice. The session, which offered LIS–Italian sign language interpreting, featured several notable speakers:

**Fabio Rossi** (Museo della Preistoria della Tuscia e della Rocca Farnese – Valentano) presented a PNRR-funded multimedia and accessibility upgrade at his museum.

**Silvia Castelli** (Biblioteca Marucelliana – Florence) introduced “Easy Room,” a multimedia station with inclusive videos, tactile panels, and hands-on workshops.

**Paola Piccione** (Musei Capitolini – Rome) discussed past efforts and ongoing strategies to improve accessibility at the Capitoline Museums, including a PNRR initiative targeting architectural, sensory, and cognitive barriers.

**Franco Niccolucci**, representing **Ariadne RI**, presented the **ATRIUM** project with a special focus on the initiatives the project is undertaking to support people with special needs.

**Alessandra Biagianti**, LIS interpreter, offered a step-by-step overview of how to produce inclusive videos in Italian Sign Language. 

**Cristina Pugi**, CEO of Prisma Cultura, concluded the session with the launch of the “Digital Reflections” competition.

Franco Niccolucci’s presentation highlighted the innovative work being carried out within the ATRIUM project, particularly through **AGLAIA** (***A**RIADNE **G**lossary in **L**IS **A**nd **I**S for **A**rchaeology*). Inspired by one of the Graces depicted in Botticelli’s *Primavera*, AGLAIA aims to develop a standardized glossary of archaeological terms in both LIS (Italian Sign Language) and IS (International Sign).

The glossary is designed to support accessible communication in museums and archaeological sites, with terminology frequently used in guided tours and educational materials. The resource will be made freely available both online and as a downloadable PDF. Ariadne RI will also offer technological support to members interested in developing similar glossaries in their respective national sign languages (e.g., BSL, LSF, DGS, LSE, etc.).

 The participation of Ariadne RI at *tourismA* 2025 offered a valuable opportunity to present the infrastructure’s ongoing activities and its involvement in European projects, with a focus on accessibility and public engagement. The event allowed for meaningful exchanges with professionals and visitors, and helped raise awareness about the ATRIUM project and the AGLAIA initiative in particular.
