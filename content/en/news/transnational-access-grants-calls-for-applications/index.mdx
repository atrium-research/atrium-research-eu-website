The ATRIUM project invites researchers to apply to participate in Transnational Access training visits to support their research. ATRIUM's Transnational Access (TNA) scheme offers researchers the possibility to apply for a fully funded placement at several different partner organisations to access expert knowledge and advice from leading Data Management organisations across Europe.

The TNA scheme aims to recruit and support approximately 200 Arts and Humanities researchers with mentorship and access to knowledge, data and tools from 14 different institutions across Europe. Researchers who are successful in their applications will be supported to visit the infrastructure providers in our consortium in person, benefiting from direct contact, knowledge sharing and network building. In total, 388 weeks of Transnational Access will be provided during the ATRIUM project.

There are two types of TNA applications:

- Individual Access – These are individual applications based on a specific research topic proposed by the applicant that match the specialisms of the host organisation.
- Summer School Access – These are fixed events during the year that provide access for a group of researchers based on a set of predetermined specialised topics.

Each ATRIUM organisation involved within the TNA scheme provides a bespoke offering based on their unique expertise and current research activities. For a full list of the possible host organisations and their offerings for the TNA scheme please see [this page](/travel-grants/). In each case, successful applicants will be integrated into the host organisation and assigned a local contact, who will work with them to identify the resources, people, outputs and services appropriate to support their project.

## Deadlines

The first collection date is 31 May, 2024, and applicants will be notified by 28 June, 2024. Calls for applications will be issued several times per year throughout the duration of the project (March 2024 to December 2028).

Individual Access applications will be offered on a rolling basis with a deadline every three months. Summer Schools will be offered 1 to 2 times a year with a fixed deadline 3 to 4 months ahead of the scheduled event.
