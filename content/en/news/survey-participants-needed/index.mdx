The ATRIUM project needs your help!

We are conducting a survey to assess if researchers from Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences have the skills required for the active use of research services and tools - namely the ones available in the [ATRIUM Catalogue.](https://atrium-research.eu/services/) Some require very specific skills, while some are easier to use.

Please participate in this survey and share your training needs. We will use this valuable feedback to build the ATRIUM Curriculum and the ATRIUM Catalogue according to the community feedback that we receive.

Take our 10 minute survey here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8Pe6IXse-zSLB4olWjaytGXHCmsecRh5AFBUllcAyAoFSYg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8Pe6IXse-zSLB4olWjaytGXHCmsecRh5AFBUllcAyAoFSYg/viewform) &#x20;

Please distribute across your networks!&#x20;
