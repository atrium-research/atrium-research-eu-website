## GoTriple data providers sharing knowledge and best practices

Whiteboards, sticky notes, pens, and papers — offline, hands-on collective thinking with colleagues facing similar challenges. The First ATRIUM Mutual Learning Exercise (MLE) took place at the office of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) in Madrid on 29 April and gave service providers and data providers the opportunity to share knowledge and best practices on (meta)data management, enrichment, aggregation and interoperability.

The MLE focused on [GoTriple](https://gotriple.eu/es), an innovative multilingual discovery platform offered by [OPERAS Research Infrastructure](https://operas-eu.org/) that is also part of the [ATRIUM Service Catalogue](https://atrium-research.eu/services/). The event was organised by the ATRIUM project in partnership with FECYT, which leads OPERAS-ES,  the Spanish Node of OPERAS.

The MLE offered a chance to reflect on data quality, explore how GoTriple presents this data, examine the integration process, and address key technical issues. Participants shared experiences and gained insights into how their publications can reach broader audiences, become more discoverable, and support a more connected, accessible research landscape in the social sciences and humanities. Ultimately, the MLE aimed to enhance data delivery and improve service to end users.

On the service provider side, there were representatives from **OPERAS**; **NET7,** the Italian IT company that is one of GoTriple's main developers and maintainers; and **FOXCUB**, a French company specialising in data and AI that is also involved in GoTriple. The Supercomputing and Networking Centre (**PSNC**) and the Institute of Literary Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences (**IBL PAN**) were the other ATRIUM partners involved in the organisation.

The event welcomed representatives from the following institutions as data providers:  **RECYT** - the Spanish Science and Technology Repository, a platform for managing, editing and accessing the content of Spanish scientific journals of proven quality; **Ediciones Complutense**, the publication service of *Universidad Complutense de Madrid* which includes dozens of journals, mainly focused on Social Sciences and Humanities; **Biblioteka Nauki**, an open access platform that makes available metadata and full texts of articles published in Polish scientific journals and selected scientific books; and **OAPEN** - Open Access Publishing in European Networks, which operates the OAPEN Library, a central repository for hosting and disseminating Open Access books and the DOAB, the Directory of Open Access Books.

## **Exercises**

The MLE featured three main exercises. The first, titled “Do I know the data I provide?”, focused on participants’ (meta)data quality. They completed a self-assessment checklist, collaborated in sub-groups with other data providers to discuss shared challenges, and joined a full-group discussion to deepen engagement with the service providers.

The second exercise, “The data journey in GoTriple”, focused on key processes such as enrichment, exposition via API, and data visualisation on the discovery platform. New data providers gained insights into these processes, while current providers shared feedback on how their data is represented in GoTriple. In both sub-group and full-group discussions, participants explored challenges and identified opportunities for improvement.

The final exercise, “Future of the GoTriple community”, focused on upcoming developments supported by four European projects, including ATRIUM. Participants were informed about these initiatives. Data providers’ expectations and feedback were gathered, as GoTriple aims to continue delivering added value to its community. A summary of the first MLE and its key outcomes will be compiled in a report to be published by June 2025.

## **Historic blackout**

The day before the first ATRIUM MLE, Spain and Portugal suffered a [historic blackout](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/28/spain-portugal-and-parts-of-france-hit-by-massive-power-outage) that left both countries without electricity for hours. This affected the MLE: some participants from other parts of Spain were unable to travel to Madrid as trains were cancelled. It also forced some adjustments to the event agenda, though nothing prevented the MLE from happening successfully. The organising team regrets this unfortunate coincidence and looks forward to working soon with the data providers who were unable to attend.
