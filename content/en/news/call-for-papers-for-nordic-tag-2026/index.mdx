## **Commoning the digital and public space: Activism for sustainable preservation** 

As a discipline, archaeology is traditionally focused on the human past. Yet in the polycrisis of the Anthropocene, where multiple timescales collide, archaeologists are increasingly placed at the interface between the contemporary past and future. With the exponential rise of technofossils, much of the millions of tons of waste produced by humans now will be around for thousands of years. And embedded in some of these technofossils is a wealth of cultural knowledge, cryptically stored in digital drives. 

How can we preserve this knowledge locked in technology for future use, while not contributing to the archives of pollution? 

The preservation of diverse cultural heritage for the generations to come (based among others on digital strategies), on preventing a digital dark age, is a matrix perspective. Yet taking into account the energy consumption of maintaining digital assets for data reuse in the future, it is not obvious how we can allow just and sustainable futures with that goal in mind.

Through activist practice, how can we raise awareness regarding strategies to foster data preservation and reuse in the transmission of past artifacts and sites? How can members of the general public leverage public action in both the public and digital space as its extension to support taking sustainability seriously, for example, through exhibitions? And how can these circumstances push Research Infrastructures beyond the public space into leading by example and being activists themselves in preserving the past and making it accessible in a just and sustainable manner?

We welcome submissions that address the implementation of sustainability strategies through activism as well as papers that tackle, in archaeology, either the issue of sustainability (related to data, artefacts, sites) or more generally forms of activist input that leverage an awareness of environmental issues at large.
