## ATRIUM seeks paper submissions for CAA 2025 S19: "Reusable Digital Research Workflows for Archaeology"

ATRIUM is seeking paper submissions for [CAA 2025 in Athens, Greece](https://2025.caaconference.org/call-for-papers/), taking place from 5-9th May 2025 at the University of West Attica. \
\
The 2025 Conference of Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) has the theme of "Digital Horizons: Embracing Heritage in an Evolving World". We are delighted to invite submissions to [Session 19 "Reusable Digital Research Workflows for Archaeology"](https://2025.caaconference.org/call-for-papers/session-list/#S19), jointly organised by DARIAH and ARIADNE, and presented by Agiatis Benardou (DARIAH) Émilie Pagé-Perron (ARIADNE), Anne Baillot (DARIAH), and Julian Richards (ARIADNE).&#x20;

The field of Archaeology has greatly benefited from the advent of digital technologies, which have enhanced Humanities and Heritage research as a whole. These advancements have facilitated the application of complex methodologies to large datasets. Recent progress in Machine Learning methods has not only improved the quantity but also the quality of both input and output data. One of the significant advantages of computation-based methods is the efficiency gained in terms of time, energy, and knowledge. However, relying on this resource economy has introduced new challenges. The goal of this session is twofold: on the one hand, it aims at presenting reusable workflows such as they are being developed in the ATRIUM project (on 3D data, geographical data, OCR of grey literature, their annotation, reusability scenarios,…). On the other hand, we aim to invite researchers outside of the ATRIUM project working on similar questions and discuss together how they approach them. In particular, we are interested in the modelisation of research scenarios in a format more accessible than technical documentation that could be included as contributions to the SSH Open Marketplace. With this call, we invite colleagues to submit papers which present the research workflows they are planning, have created, or adopted, discuss the state of reusability of workflows in a specific topical area, or other relevant papers under the thematic of our call. We encourage individuals of varied professional identity and from outside Europe to submit. We also encourage submissions related to challenges in accessing existing infrastructure, and solutions developed to overcome these challenges, or suggested steps infrastructures should take to improve the discoverability and access to their services in the context of archaeological research workflows.

This Call for Papers is open until **29th October 2024.**
