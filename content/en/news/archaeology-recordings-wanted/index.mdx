## **Archaeology Recordings Wanted To Test the Speech Transcription Portal**

 As part of the upcoming ATRIUM Researchers’ Forum about the Transcription Portal, ATRIUM is inviting archaeologists to provide recordings in Dutch, German, Italian, and English, which can be used for testing the new summarisation and translation features that will be provided by the Radboud University Speech and Language Tools and integrated in the Transcription Portal. The recordings may also be included in the tutorial being developed for the ATRIUM Curriculum.

The recordings should be:

* At least **5 minutes or longer**,
* Feature real-life recordings produced by archaeologists at work, 
* Use Dutch, German, Italian, or English language.

The recordings should be **zipped**, and, depending on the size, they can be sent via email or a secure cloud-based file transfer, e.g. [SURFfilesender](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/storage-data-management/surffilesender) to [**Christoph Draxler**](mailto:draxler@phonetik.uni-muenchen.de). 

Please also download and complete the [ATRIUM Consent form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r9w3ez5Dbbl_5Ck9PD1uPtfKOBYN2zTF/edit) to send with your recording(s). 

Contributors will also be invited to participate in the **Transcription Portal Forum,** which is planned for the autumn.

## **About the Transcription Portal**

The [Transcription Portal](https://speechandtech.eu/transcription-portal) is a web service hosted by the University of Munich and made discoverable through [CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/), one of the ATRIUM Services. It requires an academic login (either via your home institution or CLARIN).  

To use the Transcription Portal, follow the 1-2-3 setup: \
1\) upload audio files (preferably in WAV format) to the portal, \
2\) select the workflow with translation and summarization, the input language for the automatic speech recognition and the output language for the translation and/or summary, \
3\) start processing. 

The table displays the status of each individual file – when it has reached the rightmost column, processing is complete, and the transcript, translation or summary can be downloaded in one of the available formats; most probably, for archaeologists, this will be plain text.

## **How to Access Protected Applications and Data Sets within CLARIN**

Thanks to [federated login](https://www.clarin.eu/content/federated-identity), protected applications and data sets are available to anyone with an academic account (all [participating identity federations](https://www.clarin.eu/content/service-provider-federation)), see [Easy Access to Protected Resources](https://www.clarin.eu/content/easy-access-protected-resources).

For cases where an academic account does not belong to an identity federation that has ties with the Service Provider Federation, the CLARIN Identity Provider has been created, allowing users to register a CLARIN account. For information on how to do this, see this [help page on the CLARIN Forum](https://forum.clarin.eu/t/how-can-i-register-a-clarin-account/274).
