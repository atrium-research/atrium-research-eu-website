**ATRIUM & Skills4EOSC Sessions: Training Materials from a a FAIR Perspective**

*By Carol Delmazo*

\
ATRIUM and [Skills4ESOC](https://www.skills4eosc.eu/) projects have successfully concluded the twofold training dedicated to understanding and implementing the [FAIR-by-design methodology](https://www.skills4eosc.eu/resources/fair-by-design-methodology) for the production of learning materials.

The first session took place on 14th March as a webinar open to the wider community of both projects. Sonja Filiposka (Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, Skills4EOSC project) demonstrated the key six-step workflow to ensure that training materials comply with the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. With an impressive turnout of over 150 participants, the interactive session also gave the opportunity to ask and discuss questions with the trainer as well as other participants. The webinar was recorded and can be accessed via the ATRIUM YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gagjo_6lJFI\&t=7825s).

**Hands-on session**

The second session was reserved for ATRIUM partners. This hands-on training took place on 21st March and was dedicated to FAIR-iyfing already existing training materials. Resources suggested by partners were carefully analysed and three were selected by the training team consisting of Sonja Filiposka, Anastas Mishev and Vojdan Kjorveziroski, all from Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje.

During the session, participants were divided into three groups, each of which analysed and learned how to improve one of the selected training materials. Checklists helped to verify the quality and FAIRness of the resources. Very practical steps were followed to assess important aspects such as the metadata schema, attribution, licensing, and accessibility. At the end, participants shared encouraging remarks such as:

> “We managed to have a different perspective of the same resources”.

> “It has opened my eyes for things that I have never taken into account before”.

> “It made me rethink not only training materials but all the databases I work with”.

> “Some are quite easy to change and improve – just a few clicks away”.



One of ATRIUM’s main goals is to develop a comprehensive curriculum hosted on DARIAH Campus, with the FAIR-by-design methodology serving as a key guiding principle. It was fantastic to have these two session contribute to that overall goal. Many thanks to all who participated!&#x20;
