Over two days at the start of February 2024, the kick-off meeting for ATRIUM took place in Centre Marc Bloch, Berlin, hosted by DARIAH-EU. This four-year project will exploit and strengthen complementarities between four leading European infrastructures: DARIAH (digital arts and humanities), ARIADNE (archaeology), CLARIN (languages) and OPERAS (social sciences), to improve workflows and access to the state-of-the-art services available to researchers across countries, languages, domains and media. In particular, ATRIUM will support and expand services pertaining to archaeological research.

As ATRIUM brings together 17 partners and 12 affiliated entities across 12 countries, the launch event played host to over 60 guests from across Europe over the two days of planning and discussion. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac introduced the project, situating it within the European Research landscape, before the various Work Packages were outlined over the following day and a half. ATRIUM will align itself with various initiatives such as the [OSCARS Project](https://oscars-project.eu/), by providing a holistic framework for data access and organisation. Its workflows will be created using the [SSH Open Marketplace](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/ssh-open-marketplace) templates, and interoperability with [EOSC (the European Open Science Cloud)](https://eosc-portal.eu/) is a key priority for the services that ATRIUM will facilitate, by making them interoperable and ensuring the workflows are integrated.

On the second day, several breakout sessions were facilitated, where the plans and workflows for various Work Packages were planned and debated, including discussions about how best to support the project's goals of improving metadata quality, developing training materials and services, and strengthening the ties between the infrastructures and partners involved. One of ATRIUM's goals is to facilitate the development and delivery of training for digital humanities researchers. One component of this will be to make a skills requirements assessment through surveys, desk research, interviews and currently available data from previous projects in order to develop a curriculum to support cross-disciplinary research, which will then be available on [DARIAH-Campus](https://campus.dariah.eu/).
