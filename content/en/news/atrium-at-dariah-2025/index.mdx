The ATRIUM project was pleased to participate in the DARIAH Annual Event 2025, held in Göttingen, Germany, from June 17-20, 2025.

The DARIAH Annual Event, themed around "The Past," brought together digital humanities researchers, infrastructure developers, and cultural heritage professionals. ATRIUM's involvement highlighted the project's commitment to developing reusable digital research workflows that build upon established practices while innovating for future needs.

ATRIUM's presence at DARIAH 2025 demonstrated the project's integration within the broader digital humanities research ecosystem. The project featured prominently on an SSHOC poster exhibited as part of the TEXT+ Conference (organised by DARIAH-DE) which was organised for the same week, emphasising the importance of the project within the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud infrastructure. An ATRIUM poster was also available in the foyer of the Alta Mensa venue in Göttingen, with ATRIUM flyers on display.

  The centerpiece of ATRIUM's participation was the presentation "How not to reinvent the wheel – workflows as a leverage from the past to the future," delivered by Massimiliano Carloni and Vera Maria Charvát. This presentation explored how established research methodologies can be transformed and enhanced through structured digital workflows, rather than being replaced entirely. The presentation also emphasized ATRIUM's core philosophy: that effective digital research infrastructure should build upon existing scholarly practices and domain knowledge, creating workflows that are both innovative and grounded in proven methodological approaches.

  The DARIAH Annual Event 2025 provided an ideal platform for ATRIUM to engage with the broader digital humanities community. DARIAH's focus on "The Past" as a theme created natural connections with ATRIUM's work in archaeology and cultural heritage, fields where the integration of historical knowledge with digital innovation is particularly crucial, and the Annual Event served as an ideal opportunity to connect the ATRIUM community to look towards the future.
