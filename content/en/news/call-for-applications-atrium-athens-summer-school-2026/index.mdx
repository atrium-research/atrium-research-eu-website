Applications are currently open until March 9th 2026 for the ATRIUM Summer School 2026: From Maps to Data and Data to Maps: Exploring Spatial Histories, taking place in Athens, Greece, from June 29th-July 2nd.

The summer school is organized by the UNESCO Chair on Digital Methods for the Humanities and Social Sciences as part of the Horizon Europe project ATRIUM, with the cooperation of the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton and the Athena Research Centre, and will take place at the Athens University of Economics and Business in Athens, Greece. Instructors will include members of the UNESCO Chair on Digital Methods for the Humanities and Social Sciences at the Athens University of Economics and Business, the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University, the Princeton University Library, and the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH-EU).

This summer school is designed for scholars and professionals interested in exploring digital humanities methods for mapping and spatial visualization. Mapping in the digital humanities provides new perspectives on sources, enables analysis in a spatial context, and offers visual representations of arguments and narratives. Participants will be introduced to key topics, including spatial data collection, geocoding, georeferencing, map annotation, data wrangling, and different types of maps, platforms, and hosting services.

The school is open to scholars from all disciplines, regardless of technical background. Experience with mapping, GIS methods, tools, and concepts is welcome but not required. This summer school will be of particular interest to those in History, Archaeology, Urban Studies, Architecture, Cultural Studies, Public Humanities, and Photography. Knowledge of Greek is not required.
