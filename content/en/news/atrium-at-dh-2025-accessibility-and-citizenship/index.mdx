The 2025 edition of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organization’s (ADHO) annual conference will be held from July 14-18, 2025 at **NOVA-FCSH in Lisbon**. This year’s conference focuses on the theme [‘Building access and accessibility, open science to all citizens’](https://dh2025.adho.org/).

Since the 2002 Budapest Open Access Declaration, the movement for more equitable access to research has grown, evolving into broader frameworks such as Open Science and Open Scholarship. These approaches emphasize not only free access but also ethical and technical considerations related to data, infrastructure, and collaboration. Through international and institutional policies, efforts are being made to enhance transparency, inclusion, and public participation in scientific knowledge.

Within this context, digital humanities play a key role by using digital tools to democratize access, engage communities, and respond to societal challenges.
