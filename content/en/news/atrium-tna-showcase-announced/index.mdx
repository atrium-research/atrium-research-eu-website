Want to learn more about the ATRIUM transnational access (TNA) research grant scheme? Join us for the first ATRIUM TNA Showcase, which features recipients of the scheme who have completed summer schools and individual access placements across Europe.

\
TNA participants, prospective applicants, and the wider ATRIUM community are all invited to two sessions to learn about project outcomes, the different placements available, and to bring any questions they might have about the scheme. 

\
We are excited to feature Dr Nicky Garland, Dr Malamatenia Panagiotou, Peter Gathoni, Dr Mariia Lobanova, and Vasiliki Sampa, who will share how the TNA scheme supported their projects over the past year at leading data management research centres across Europe, including the Archaeology Data Service, University of York, the Summer School in Brno, Czechia, and School of Computer Science at University of Sheffield.
