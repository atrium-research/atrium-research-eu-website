ATRIUM had the pleasure of being presented at the CLARIN Annual Conference 2025 with the poster 'MetaCat suite: Towards a systematic analysis of catalogues' (Tuesday 30 September - Thursday 2 October, Eventhotel Pyramide, Vienna, Austria).

One of the central objectives of the ATRIUM project is to improve the discoverability of resources in the arts and humanities by aligning metadata curation and enrichment workflows between major data catalogues in the domain (ARIADNE Knowledge Base, CLARIN VLO, GoTriple, SSH Open Marketplace). Towards this end, the ATRIUM team is developing MetaCat, a suite comprising a systematic, high-level, machine-readable overview of the data represented in the catalogues, together with the semantic artefacts used, accompanied by tooling that allows interactive exploration, analysis and comparison of this information.

The shared knowledge graph forms the basis for interactive tools that allow exploration,
visualisation, comparison, and alignment of resources across Europe's Arts & Humanities.

Authors: Massimiliano Carloni, Matej Durco, Vera Maria Charvát, Twan Goosen,
Julien Homo, Antoine Isaac, Michael Kurzmeier, Alessia Bardi
