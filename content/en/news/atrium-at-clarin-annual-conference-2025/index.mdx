ATRIUM had the pleasure of being presented three times at the CLARIN Annual Conference 2025 with the **posters 'MetaCat suite: Towards a systematic analysis of catalogues'**, '**Engaging Researchers for Improving Services and Training: Insights from the ATRIUM Project'** as well as the **presentation 'State of the Technical Infrastructure'.**&#x20;

The conference took place on Tuesday, 30 September to Thursday, 2 October at the Eventhotel Pyramide, Vienna, Austria.&#x20;

## Poster: 'MetaCat suite: Towards a systematic analysis of catalogues

*Authors: Massimiliano Carloni, Matej Durco, Vera Maria Charvát, Twan Goosen, Julien Homo, Antoine Isaac, Michael Kurzmeier, Alessia Bardi*

One of the central objectives of the ATRIUM project is to improve the discoverability of resources in the arts and humanities by aligning metadata curation and enrichment workflows between major data catalogues in the domain (ARIADNE Knowledge Base, CLARIN VLO, GoTriple, SSH Open Marketplace). Towards this end, the ATRIUM team is developing MetaCat, a suite comprising a systematic, high-level, machine-readable overview of the data represented in the catalogues, together with the semantic artefacts used, accompanied by tooling that allows interactive exploration, analysis and comparison of this information.

The shared knowledge graph forms the basis for interactive tools that allow exploration,
visualisation, comparison, and alignment of resources across Europe's Arts & Humanities.

## **Presentation: 'State of the Technical Infrastructure'**

*Author: Dieter Van Uytvanck*

This presentation presented the WP6 'Service Interoperability and EOSC Integration' work on the Digital Object Gateway (DOG).&#x20;

Digital Object Gateway is an abstraction layer for accessing Digital Objects that are referred to with a Persistent Identifier ( ) or URL. The end user of DOG does not need to know the specifics of how to access one particular data repository. Instead, by sending the identifier of an object (typically the landing page) to the DOG, the DOG can perform a range of standard operations to explore and process the object.

## Poster: '**Engaging Researchers for Improving Services and Training: Insights from the ATRIUM Project'**

*Authors: Carol Delmazo (OPERAS), Iulianna van der Lek (CLARIN ERIC), Anastasia Gasia (AUEB), Sarah Bénière (INRIA), Maria Ilvanidou (AUEB), Sy Holsinger (OPERAS AISBL), Vera Maria Charvát (OEAW), Canan Arikan-Caba (University of Vienna)*

The poster presented the ATRIUM skills assessment survey, which was conducted to evaluate whether researchers from arts, humanities and social sciences have the required skills to actively use the services and tools available in the ATRIUM Catalogue. It also gathered insights into training gaps to inform the ATRIUM curriculum design. The analysis is ongoing and expected to conclude by August 2025. ATRIUM project connects four leading Research Infrastructures — DARIAH, ARIADNE, CLARIN, and OPERAS — to improve access to digital services and advance frontier knowledge in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. It relies on strong community engagement, with researcher participation playing a central role. Key activities include workshops like the Researcher Forum (RF) and a survey that gathered 334 responses from researchers in 31 countries, aimed at identifying skills gaps and training needs.
