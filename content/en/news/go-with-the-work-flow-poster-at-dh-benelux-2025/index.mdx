ATRIUM had the pleasure to be presented at the annual [DH Benelux Conference](https://2025.dhbenelux.org), which took place 3 – 6 June 2025 at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Emilie Page-Peron and Anne Baillot presented the poster 'Go with the (Work)Flow! Creating Reusable and Replicable Workflows for Digital Humanities Research'.&#x20;

The poster highlighted how workflows are fundamental in all scholarly processes, yet they lack academic recognition. Recognizing the importance of workflows in fostering a culture of reusability and sustainability, ATRIUM works towards a better formalization, a better recognition, and a better quality of reusable workflows, with archeological datasets as use cases. A featured use case demonstrates the IIIF protocol in action, enabling remote visual annotation of rock art datasets from the UK and Sweden.&#x20;

So that workflows are easily accessible and adhere to FAIR principles, ATRIUM workflow descriptions will be hosted on the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace. Through this work, ATRIUM not only enhances access to digital tools but also reframes workflows as essential, citable research outputs.
