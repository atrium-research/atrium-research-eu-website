**Call for papers: 15 September 2025 – 26 October 2025**\
Conference: 31 March – 4 April 2026, Vienna, Austria\
Chairs: Émilie Pagé-Perron (ADS), Marco Callieri (CNR) & Julian Richards (ADS)

We invite papers from ATRIUM partners and beyond to share applications in practical case studies of FAIR workflows, especially in the context of data reuse. We encourage individuals from diverse professional backgrounds and outside Europe to submit to the upcoming session at <Link link={{"discriminant":"external","value":"https://2026.caaconference.org"}}>CAA2026</Link>.&#x20;

**To apply, please submit paper abstracts (1,000 words maximum, plus up to 3 citations) through the CAA's [Conference Management Toolkit](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2FCAA2025), with more information found <Link link={{"discriminant":"external","value":"https://2026.caaconference.org/call-for-papers-and-posters/"}}>here</Link>.**&#x20;

Topics can encompass: 

* Strategies and tools for reusing legacy datasets
* Adoption of ATRIUM & ARIADNE tools, or other tools facilitating research workflows and their demonstrators
* Impact & sustainability of FAIR workflow demonstrators 
* Metadata enrichment and its applications in FAIRification
* Other related topics

### **End-to-End Reusable Archaeological Data Workflows: Spotlight on the Demonstrator Model**

The FAIR principles have become one of the primary objectives in data production for archaeological projects: being able to produce data that serves more than the project's immediate purpose, long after the project’s completion, has proven their importance in the field. However, achieving FAIR status for a single project’s data cannot be the end. Even if the result of some spot actions fulfils the four FAIR principles, too often the project effort, in terms of methodology and workflow, remains an isolated process, non-replicable and too cumbersome.

Providing access to individual datasets and tools in isolation from each other is insufficient, and sustainable and standardised workflows, relying on dedicated tools and infrastructures, can address this issue, facilitating the establishment of a **FAIR-by-design** strategy for research projects. Researchers should be able to shape a project’s data flow and management from the very beginning of a project, using these workflows, ensuring the data aspect of their results is FAIR without the need for custom, cumbersome one-shot solutions. 

Such workflows are now being developed, albeit not systematically. As the field builds knowledge around the development and maintenance of sustainable research workflows, we have learned that the ideal scenario includes the elaboration of **demonstrators**, an essential component of FAIR research workflows. In this, communities play a key role; the technologies are available, but people are essential to ensure their uptake. Our session therefore addresses the CAA2026 conference theme head-on.

Research infrastructures provide important pillars of the community landscape. Advancing FronTier Research In the Arts and hUManities is a four-year European project that connects the digital infrastructures ARIADNE, DARIAH, CLARIN, and OPERAS, highlighting the composability of services to provide concrete solutions for both data management and workflow reusability challenges in Archaeology. Its thirty constituent partners endeavour, among other objectives, to prepare research workflows and associated demonstrators for the major usual computational research tasks on text, image, 3D, sound, and geographic data in the domain of Archaeology, and to make these available to the wider community via the SSHOC Open Marketplace. Demonstrators are real-world examples of workflow implementations, key to showing how research workflows can be reused and adapted to different project contexts, providing the means to render data really FAIR.

This session is co-organised by [The Archaeology Data Service]([https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/]\(https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/\)) and the [research infrastructure ARIADNE]([https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu/]\(https://www.ariadne-research-infrastructure.eu/\)) as part of the ATRIUM project. The goal of the session is to showcase this demonstrator model, exploring the current status and trends of FAIR workflows, tools, and infrastructures. By showcasing existing demonstrators of such research workflows and comparing the outcomes of case studies, this session aims to foster dialogue & best practices, and reflect on issues and facilitators for sustainable data reuse.
