In March and April we were pleased to host our first TNA Showcases and Q\&A sessions, designed to spotlight some of the recipients of the TNA travel grants. These two sessions created an opportunity for TNA participants, prospective applicants, and the wider ATRIUM community to learn about project outcomes and the different placements as well as to ask any questions.

In our first session on 28th March, Dr Nicky Garland (Archaeology Data Service) introduced the travel grant scheme and shared his experiences of attending the Summer School in Brno, Czech Republic. We also featured Dr Malamatenia Panagiotou (University of the Aegean, Greece), who presented “Exploring NLP Applications in Food Research: my ATRIUM TNA visit to the GATE group”. This was followed by Vasiliki Sampa (Athena Research Centre) discussing through digital tools for NLP how Euripides portrayed women and gender norms in Ancient Greek tragedies. 

On 4th April, after Dr Garland introduced the scheme, Dr Mariia Lobanova (Odesa Archaeological Museum of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine) presented “Collecting and processing archeological data from the materials of the Odesa Archeological Museum”.   Afterwards, Peter Gathoni (British Institute of East Africa / BIEA) delivered a presentation about how the ADS Summer School supported the digitisation project currently undertaken at BIEA archives.
