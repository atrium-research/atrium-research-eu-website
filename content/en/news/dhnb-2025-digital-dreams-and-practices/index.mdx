ATRIUM had the pleasure to be presented at [The Digital Humanities in the Nordic & Baltic Countries (DHNB2025)](https://dhnb.eu/conferences/dhnb2025/) conference, “Digital Dreams and Practices”, held on 5-7 March 2025 at the Estonian National Museum.

The conference brought together approximately 230 DH scholars, computational linguists, and cultural heritage professionals from Estonia, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Denmark, Norway, and 16 other countries, including Japan. Featuring a vibrant mix of presentations, workshops, and panel discussions, key themes of the conference included (1) integration of computational techniques and humanities, (2) the transition of DH research into societal practice, and (3) the practical applications of AI in the humanities. 

[CLARIN ERIC](https://www.clarin.eu/content/about-clarin), one of the consortium partners in ATRIUM, participated in the conference with two presentations related to training and upskilling needs in the age of AI. Iulianna van der Lek, Training and Education Officer at CLARIN, also took the opportunity to promote the ATRIUM project at the CLARIN booth.

The event underscored the growing importance of digital methods and research infrastructures in addressing complex cultural and historical questions and reinforced the role of regional collaboration in advancing digital humanities research.

The next DHNB conference in 2026 will be organised by the Centre for Digital Textual Heritage and Centre for Humanities Computing at Aarhus University.
