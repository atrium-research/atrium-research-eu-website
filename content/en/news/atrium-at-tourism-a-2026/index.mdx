ATRIUM will take part in **tourismA 2026**, one of Italy’s most important international events dedicated to archaeology, cultural heritage, and the communication of the ancient world. Held every year in Florence at the prestigious **Palazzo dei Congressi**, tourismA is a three-day event that brings together museums, research institutions, universities, cultural associations, heritage professionals, tourism operators, and innovators. With around 13,000 visitors, tourismA offers a unique space for dialogue, visibility, and exchange on the enhancement and communication of cultural heritage.

As part of the programme, ATRIUM will organise a dedicated conference session and will also be present with a joint stand together with <Link link={{"discriminant":"external","value":"https://www.artemis-twin.eu/"}}>the ARTEMIS project</Link> offering visitors the opportunity to explore ongoing research activities, digital workflows, and concrete use cases developed within both European initiatives.
