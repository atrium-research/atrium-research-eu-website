ATRIUM had the pleasure of being presented at the Open Science Conference 2025 with the poster 'Enhancing transparency and reusability through Diamond publishing model: Transformations, A DARIAH Journal'.

The [**Open Science Conference**](https://www.open-science-conference.eu/) is an annual international conference dedicated to the Open Science movement that took place October 8 – 9, 2025 in Hamburg, Germany.&#x20;

### ‘Enhancing transparency and reusability through Diamond publishing model: *Transformations, A DARIAH Journal*’

Françoise Gouzi, Francesco Gelati, Anne Baillot and Toma Tasovac presented ‘Enhancing transparency and reusability through Diamond publishing model: *Transformations, A DARIAH Journal*’, focusing on how *Transformations* adopts the ATRIUM Peer Review Framework for open peer-review processes.

The ATRIUM Peer Review Framework are guidelines for a new peer review evaluation framework for crediting non-traditional outputs, such as workflow papers, datasets, data papers, training materials and software developments. It gives practical and concrete advice, methods and recommendations on how to review non-traditional research outputs.&#x20;

These guidelines are adopted in *Transformations: A DARIAH Journal* to assess various forms of non-traditional outputs, such as workflows, data sets, data papers, annotation practices, software tools and training materials, as well as traditional scholarly papers. *Transformations* Diamond publishing model helps researchers gain visibility and credit in institutional and journal evaluations for a diversity of research outputs.  This creates a more inclusive research environment and wider knowledge sharing.
