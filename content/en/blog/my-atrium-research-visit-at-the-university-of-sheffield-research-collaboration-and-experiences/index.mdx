My ATRIUM Research Visit at the University of Sheffield: Research, Collaboration, and Experiences

I am a PhD student in Computer Science in Brazil, with research at the intersection of data science and Natural Language Processing. My work focuses on the large-scale analysis of online communication on messaging platforms, particularly WhatsApp and Telegram. In my doctoral research, I explore the “underground” dynamics of messaging-app groups, investigating coordinated campaigns, harmful attacks, and political polarisation. Messaging apps have increasingly become spaces for political mobilisation, creating conditions in which abusive behaviours, coordinated practices, and narrative amplification can develop and persist. More recently, my research has concentrated on how fear-based and othering narratives emerge and spread within these platforms, especially in political contexts, and how such narratives relate to real-world events. Through the Transnational Access scheme of the ATRIUM programme, I had the opportunity to spend three months (September–December) on a research visit at the University of Sheffield. This period allowed me to work in a highly stimulating academic environment, engage with researchers whose expertise closely aligns with my work, and advance key components of my doctoral research.&#x20;

**Research Activities**

During my research visit, I engaged in several activities that were central to advancing my doctoral work. Daily, I went to the university, where I worked closely alongside colleagues and had frequent opportunities for discussion. These daily routines were often accompanied by the classic English tea with milk, a memorable part of everyday life at the university. I initially dedicated time to deepening my understanding of the concept of othering and how it manifests in political contexts. Understanding this concept is essential for studying fear-based narratives. I then took full advantage of the research environment and available infrastructure to work on the creation of a unique dataset focused on othering language, a narrative strategy commonly used to divide groups and attack out-groups in political discourse. This dataset represents a key resource for analysing fear-related communication and for training and evaluating computational models capable of identifying such narratives at scale. Developing this resource during the visit allowed me to refine annotation strategies, improve data quality, and ensure methodological consistency. Throughout this process, I applied analytical strategies and methodological approaches learned during interaction with members of the research group. Their feedback and expertise directly influenced both the design of the dataset and the analytical decisions made. As a direct result of this research period, I developed the first dataset dedicated specifically to othering language in messaging platforms, along with several promising findings. These results are currently being prepared for submission to a top-tier (A1) academic conference.

**Integration into university life: beyond the lab** One of the highlights of my visit was how easy it was to feel part of the university community. Collaboration in Sheffield clearly goes beyond offices and meetings, and daily interactions quickly turned into meaningful connections. As a Brazilian, I could not stay in Sheffield without playing football. I joined the university football team and took part in a championship with teams from other universities, with matches every Tuesday. We had a great run, winning three out of four games, and I was especially happy to contribute by scoring goals in every match, alongside the best midfield partner, Owen Cook. These moments on the pitch were not just fun. They helped build connections and strengthen collaboration naturally, while also making me feel at home. Our ComFootball team is in third place, and now I'm cheering for them here from Brazil.&#x20;

**Experiencing Sheffield: the best place for sports**
I am also a big sports fan, and I could not stay in Sheffield without experiencing live football in the city. My first visit was to Sheffield United’s stadium for the match between Sheffield United and Southampton. United scored the opening goal, but unfortunately, conceded two goals in the second half and ended up losing the match. Despite the result, it was an amazing experience watching the world’s first professional football team play in its home city.
I also had the chance to visit the Utilita Arena Sheffield twice to watch the Sheffield Steelers, and I can proudly say I had a 100% success rate. The team won both matches I attended. The atmosphere in the arena was amazing. I really enjoy ice hockey, and this was my first time watching a live game in person, which made the experience even more special.

**Experiencing Sheffield: the Christmas Market** My final months in Sheffield were especially memorable, as I had the chance to experience the city during the Christmas season. The festive atmosphere was everywhere, from carols and theatre performances to the Christmas Market in the city centre. The food, the people, the warm apple crumble, and the mulled wine all came together to create a truly wonderful experience. It was a perfect way to end my time in Sheffield and made the city feel even more welcoming and special.

**Final Remarks and Acknowledgements**
I am very grateful to the ATRIUM programme for making this research visit possible, and to everyone at the University of Sheffield who welcomed me and supported my work during this period.  Overall, this experience had a very positive impact and was essential for the advancement of my research. The collaboration, academic environment, and daily interactions played a crucial role in strengthening the theoretical, methodological, and practical aspects of my PhD work.


I would especially like to thank Diana Maynard for accepting me and for her guidance, as well as for the valuable feedback and advice she provided throughout the project. I am also very grateful to Jo Wright for managing all the logistics and for making the stay enjoyable.
I would like to thank my colleagues for the many interesting and valuable conversations, particularly Owen Cook and Fatima Haouari. I am also thankful to my nearby office colleagues, Ibrahim and Eliseu, whose daily presence and informal exchanges made the experience even more enjoyable. I would also like to thank João Leite for his helpful advice and support when I first arrived in the city.
