A google search to determine the approximate number of archives globally reveals that it is largely unknown. This highlights the importance of this resource, as its full value and potential is priceless. There are various types of archives, but in this blog, we view them through two main lenses: those that want to share their data \[either partially or fully] and those that simply do not want to do so at the moment. Both, I believe, are important and have either started or are considering starting the process of digitisation or digital preservation in the near future.

From November 10th to 14th, I attended the ATRIUM-Archaeological Data Service \[ADS] Field School on digital archiving at the University of York, U.K. Here, I gained a comprehensive understanding of digitisation and digital preservation. For that reason, I would like to share a few obvious but significant tips on how to avoid common pitfalls in this practice. There are many profound works on this topic, but here is a quick read on the subject with relatable examples of what one may face on a daily basis:

**Familiarise yourself with your archive materials and data.**&#x20;

Due to the richness of archives as a resource, one will find numerous materials and a variety of objects in a repository/archive. This may range from newspapers, artefacts, CDs, videotapes, photographs, and slides, among others. It is important to take time and know what is available and what their condition is. It is also important that custodians/people who work in the archive ask themselves the following questions:What is the mission/aim of the archive? What path should they follow? Do they want to share the information at the moment or not, or perhaps in the future? If it is open to the public, is it for a specific target audience or for everyone? Will they be taking new material or not? What is the quantity and quality of the available material, and do some already exist in digital form? These questions will help solidify the identity of the archive or repository, which is necessary when forming the blueprint of a data management plan. This is because it provides an idea of what needs to be done and, most importantly, what it will cost to do so. Consider the costs involved in this.


**Digitisation and digital preservation processes can be expensive.**&#x20;

From the digitising process itself to storage and even maintenance. Other factors include the cost of software needed, online backups, and the purchase and maintenance of digitising and storage equipment.  In a world of limited funding, this can be navigated in two ways: saving costs or applying for funding to complement the existing budgets. The former is easier, as the latter may have many requirements that few institutions can meet. There are several ways in which an archive can save costs while running its processes. The first is implementing a good data management plan, such as saving files accurately to save time and resources for accessing them. This point may seem simple, but it is crucial. With a good data management plan, one would easily know which material is important and which is not a priority. The data management plan will also clear the clutter of files that have either been repeated or are not important.


In terms of funding, there are various sources, such asTransnational Access Scheme Grants | ATRIUM, which essentially receives applications for its Transnational Access (TNA) scheme, offering fully funded placements across Europe for researchers. This initiative is designed to support arts and humanities. researchers by providing access to expert knowledge, mentorship, and tools from leading data management organisations. \[This may vary from time to time so it's good to check the website from time to time.] The Grants and Funding - Archives at the National Archives’ Grants and Funding Office: here they offer grants for projects such as cataloguing, records at risk, research, and public engagement. FIDA Project Funding - ICA: which provides grants for professional development, training, and basic archival skills in developing nations.
Other local organisations, such as NGOs and universities, may come in handy. On the cost factor, training of personnel or receiving volunteers from other institutions may help, as  it reduces operational costs. One needs to be very open-minded and flexible about this. Other ways to be flexible are elaborated on below.


**Be flexible and open-minded in your operations.**&#x20;

Flexibility can be implemented in terms of having a culture of inclusivity by creating a collaborative environment, being on the lookout for new trends, improving  the archival workflow when needed, and having the ability to make independent changes as things evolve in one’s country/region. Traditional bureaucracy in organisations may be detrimental to archives. For example, concerns may be raised by the  IT or quality assurance departments. If not taken seriously and acted upon, they may be very costly in the future or even lead to data loss. Therefore, people need to be inclusive and open enough so that adverse trends can be spotted and acted upon in due time. This also involves adapting to data storage and dissemination trends. The archiving sector is currently evolving, and new techniques such as coding and R have become instrumental. Some archives may perform better when they collaborate with local institutions, such as universities, or  international organisations with similar practices. The ADS has mastered this art not only in its practice but also in the dissemination of knowledge. This can be achieved by simplifying academic jargon and collaborating with numerous institutions, including schools and the local community.\


**The ability to evolve in terms of practice.**&#x20;

With the world becoming uncertain every day, from the economy and freedoms to the security of various regions across the world. Therefore, it is very important that archives critically consider the possibility of online backups. Information may be targeted by various groups with various intentions, either physically or through cyberattacks. It may or may not happen, but the risk is worth assessing and acting on.


**Use of Free Materials by Online Institutions such as the ADS Website and Other Institutions** There are many free materials to improve various aspects and departments of an archive, from the IT section to the data management team. The materials include: Blogs/short reads by the ADS team; Blog – Archaeology Data Service. This can be utilised to explore experiences and what to watch out for or even what is new by the ADS team and community. Free software and tools such as DROID: file format identification tool, which is data management software. It was developed by the National Archives to perform automated batch identification of the formats. Rapid Assessment Model (DPC RAM) - Digital Preservation Coalition, a digital preservation maturity modelling tool designed to enable rapid benchmarking of an organisation’s digital preservation capability and facilitate continuous improvement over time. Sources such as the Advocacy - Digital Preservation Handbook, which offer open-access training resources in digital preservation These can be explored and used for self-improvement by departments and organisations. These are all part of the key principles and practices of the ADS that encourage open research, data reuse, and collaboration. The best news about this is that you can stumble upon other resources by exploring the ADS website.

**Take-home from summer school.**

The main lesson I learnt from the summer school is about the  effective workflow of the ADS and the institution's ability to evolve. I was able to witness this not only with digital archiving and preservation practices but also in a friendly and open environment. We covered emerging topics, such as how institutions are discussing current debates on reducing their carbon footprints. Throughout this process, we asked questions and contributed to various topics, bringing our personal experiences to the fore. Lastly, I believe we were all able to make good friends and connections that will be fundamental in future research. This was honestly very important to me.
