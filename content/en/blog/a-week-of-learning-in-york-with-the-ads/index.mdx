From 10 to 14 November 2025 I had the opportunity to join the Archaeology Data Service (ADS) Summer School, and although the trip was long and the weather was quite cold, the atmosphere made it completely worth it. We started with a welcome, an introduction to the work of the ADS, and a tour of King’s Manor and the ADS offices.

The medieval setting gave the whole week a special feel, and the campus squirrels — including the famous Betty — added a bit of charm to our breaks. Everyone at the ADS was friendly and open, and Nicky Garland, Training and Communications Manager of ADS, who stayed with us throughout the programme, was an excellent host and presenter. Across the week we explored open research in cultural heritage, the FAIR and CARE principles, data management planning, metadata, digital preservation, file formats, storage, and strategies for selecting and retaining material. We also learned how archive workflows operate and how research can be shared in ways that help others discover and reuse it. There were hands-on activities every day, and the Lego Metadata for Reproducibility game stood out as a fun and memorable way to bring the ideas to life.

The discussions on communication, archive interfaces, and digital publication helped connect all the topics. They showed how planning, clarity, and good documentation can make a real difference for anyone working with research data. Nicky guided each session with patience and a clear sense of direction, which made the more technical parts feel manageable. The final day brought everything together. We wrapped up with a Carpentries session in R, followed by individual meetings with ADS specialists. My one-to-one discussion with Kieron Niven, Standards Manager at ADS and HSDS, was especially helpful. He shared detailed insights on ADS policies and strategies that I know I’ll use in my work. I left the programme feeling supported, informed, and genuinely grateful for the kindness and effort of the entire ADS team.
