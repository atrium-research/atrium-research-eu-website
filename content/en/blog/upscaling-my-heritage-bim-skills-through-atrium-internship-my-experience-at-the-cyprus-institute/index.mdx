By joining the ATRIUM Project Transnational Access Scheme (TNA), I was able to actively participate in relevant research activities ongoing at the Cyprus Institute, an experience that turned out to be enlightening and transformative. During my TNA at the VELab, I had the opportunity to understand better the specialized field of Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM). The experience started with an exchange of ideas. I had the chance to introduce myself, share my architectural background, and discuss my interest in preserving cultural heritage. In turn, I learned about the teamâ€™s ongoing projects and expertise. This open-dialogue set the stage for an enriching learning experience that balanced structured training with collaborative exploration.

My internship at CyI began by learning the critical metadata necessary for accurately documenting and modelling heritage buildings. This included understanding historic phases (4th BIM dimension) and how these are represented in a BIM environment, an essential step for maintaining the authenticity and context of heritage buildings. The HBIM process at VELab consists of the integration of various data sources to create a comprehensive digital twin. I worked with laser scan data, photogrammetric surveys, and archival materials to develop a multi-faceted understanding of built heritage structures. The challenge lays in harmonizing these different data types, each with its own level of detail and accuracy, into a single cohesive representation model. This task required meticulous attention to detail and a solid understanding of the strengths and limitations of each data source. The hands-on experience in modelling unique architectural elements found in Cypriot heritage buildings was a highlight. From intricately detailed stonework to ornate timber roof structures, these elements required not just technical precision but a sensitivity to set the appropriate geometrical parameters for future modifications.

My experience at the VELab underscored the importance of collaboration in HBIM projects. Working alongside the team, I analysed examples from previous projects, which gave me insight into real-world applications of heritage BIM. Together, we identified gaps and challenges in existing workflows and developed a comprehensive table of metadata to streamline the integration of diverse datasets.

This table became a cornerstone of my work, as I helped craft a first draft of standardized metadata entries for a more automated and efficient heritage BIM workflow. This effort was not just about organizing data but about bridging disciplines; bringing together conservation science, materials analysis, and digital modelling into a cohesive framework.

By empowering me to participate in national and European projects, engaging in community-oriented research, and harnessing BIM and VR for building conservation, my experience at the VELab shaped me. Through my training, I can say that I obtained a significant number of skills that will help me achieve my goal, which is to positively impact on how we preserve and promote the value of our rich cultural heritage.
