The General Assembly consists of one representative of each partner with one vote each. The General Assembly meets once a year and makes decisions on research and project management activities such as strategy, amendments to the Consortium Agreement, issues experienced by partners, finances etc.

The Executive Board is a committee made up of four research infrastructures (DARIAH, ARIADNE, CLARIN, OPERAS) with one vote each per representative. The bimonthly meetings take decisions on daily work, check if tasks are properly executed or implemented, and provide technical answers at the task level.

As Coordinator, DARIAH acts as an intermediary between the parties and the granting authority of the European Commission. DARIAH monitors progress of the project as well as collecting and submitting reports and deliverables.
