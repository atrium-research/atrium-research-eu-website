The PBL/ELB infrastructure is used to collect, describe, organise and make available bibliographic
data. The infrastructure works at the intersection of digital humanities, social sciences and
computer science. The infrastructure offers access to the team of experienced and enthusiastic data
scientists/analysts, developers and project managers
([https://computations.eu/people/](https://computations.eu/people/)). The infrastructure is
particularly interested in supporting humanist researchers, the development of tools and analysis of
literary data, the creation of international bibliographic resources, and the improvement of data
and publication quality. We are looking for literary scholars to support data and metadata driven
research activities (papers, projects) and data scientists to share knowledge, workflows and
experience.

A new addition to the infrastructure is the portfolio of sevices developed within the Dariah.lab
project available on [Github](https://github.com/CHC-Computations). It features for example
Harmonize, an open source discovery system and Corpus of Literary Discourse, a collection of texts
covering Polish literary discourse from 1822 to 2022.

The infrastructure maintains two services:

* The Polish Literary Bibliography (PBL) which is a bibliography of Polish literature, theatre and
  feature films and is a widely accessible, free service used by researchers, pupils, students,
  journalists, cultural animators or librarians. Already a bibliographic database, PBL is equipped
  with a 'generous' interface and an extensive data in accordance with Semantic Web methodology.
* ELB (European Literary Bibliography) is a joint project of Czech Literary Bibliography and Polish
  Literary Bibliography, started in 2020. Its goal is to integrate the data of both bibliographies
  through automated data harmonisation and LOD technologies. It is ultimately intended to be the
  infrastructure for open literary bibliographic data at the European level that is currently
  dispersed in many places. The ELB currently has so far aggregated Czech, Finnish, Spanish and
  Polish datasets.

## Services currently offered by the infrastructure

1. [European Literary Bibliography](http://literarybibliography.eu)

   The European Literary Bibliography offers:

   * collecting bibliographical data on literature and literary science from existing sources, unifying them based on joint descriptive system (LiBRI thesaurus),
   * data enrichment (persistent identifiers – VIAF, Geonames, LOC subject headings etc.),
   * data LOD-ification (interconnection to Wikidata),
   * development of an infrastructure for data-driven research on bibliodata.
2. [Polish Literary Bibliography](https://pbl.ibl.waw.pl)

   The PBL service allows users to browse bibliographic documentation both through text searches and
   through a structure of subject headwords reproducing a map of Polish literary, theatrical and
   film culture. The data collected in the service is open research data. PBL offers queries for
   research/projects, support in data processing and bibliographic methodological consultations. The
   resource is developed through both automated data processing and the manual work of more than 10
   full-time cataloguers.
3. Support for researchers to use digital humanities tools and adapt them to the specificities of
   academic inquiry.
