The next call will open later in March 2025.

The ATRIUM project is now accepting applications for its Transnational Access (TNA) scheme, offering fully funded placements across Europe for researchers. This initiative is designed to support Arts and Humanities researchers by providing access to expert knowledge, mentorship, and tools from leading Data Management organisations.

Successful applicants will have the opportunity to visit one of 14 different host organisations across Europe, benefiting from direct contact, knowledge sharing and network building. In total 388 weeks of Transnational Access visits will be provided during the ATRIUM project, aiming to support approximately 200 researchers.

There are two types of TNA applications:

* **Individual Access** – Tailored placements based on your own specific research topic that matches the specialisms of a chosen host organisation.
* **Summer School Access** – Fixed group training sessions on predetermined specialised topics that occur at several fixed points during the year.

Each ATRIUM organisation involved within the TNA scheme provides a unique offering based on their expertise and current research activities. For a full list of the possible host organisations and their offerings please see below.

Successful applicants will be integrated into the host organisation and assigned a local contact, who will work with them to identify the resources, people, outputs and services that best support their project.
