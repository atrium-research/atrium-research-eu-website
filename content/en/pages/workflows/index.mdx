Workflows are often overlooked in the arts and humanities but are essential for research. Workflows describe specific research scenarios to provide researchers with a clear step-by-step guide to help them integrate different tools and methods to achieve their goals.

ATRIUM develops and shares workflows that help researchers integrate digital methods into their work. These guides outline how to navigate the research data lifecycle from start to finish.

ATRIUM workflows are hosted and built using templates from the [SSH Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/search?order=score\&q=atrium\&categories=workflow). Browse the ATRIUM Workflow catalogue below:
