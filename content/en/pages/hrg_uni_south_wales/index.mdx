The <Link link={{"discriminant":"external","value":"https://hypermedia.research.southwales.ac.uk/"}}>Hypermedia Research Group</Link> (HRG) at the University of South Wales is located at the Trefforest campus, in Pontypridd, South Wales. The HRG has been active in intelligent hypermedia systems and Knowledge Organization Systems since 1991. Cultural heritage and the semantic interoperability of archaeological datasets have been a particular focus. Current members include Ceri Binding and Douglas Tudhope.

The HRG has participated in EC ARIADNE and ARIADNEplus, SEADDA and also the UK AHRC STAR, STELLAR, SENESCHAL projects in the area of archaeology research infrastructure. Through this participation, the HRG has developed a portfolio of mature, production-level semantic services that can support various stages in the research process, including:, discovery, vocabulary mapping, annotation, enrichment, processing, analysis and visualisation. Additionally, advice and assistance can be offered on achieving vocabulary mappings (including PeriodO), normalisation, annotation, data conversion and data cleaning, linked data and semantic search.

The most prominent services are briefly listed below. For further details, see ARIADNEPlus D15.2 <Link link={{"discriminant":"external"}}>[https://zenodo.org/records/7528755](https://zenodo.org/records/7528755)</Link> and <Link link={{"discriminant":"external"}}>[https://hypermedia.research.southwales.ac.uk/kos/](https://hypermedia.research.southwales.ac.uk/kos/)</Link>

## Services currently offered by the infrastructure

### Vocabulary Matching Tool&#x20;

Interactive mapping tool to map source vocabularies or term lists to the Getty AAT, as used in ARIADNEplus.

### Temporal normalization services&#x20;

Normalization based on the wide set of date patterns and variant expressions for time spans commonly used in archaeology. The services are based on regular expression pattern matches and lookups from standard authority lists, with output as start/end years (in ISO 8601 format), relative to Common Era (CE). The languages supported are Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, Welsh.

### Temporal NLP/NER services&#x20;

Services provides NLP and in particular Named Entity Recognition (NER) of temporal expressions in text documents. The services are developed in a unified (open source) Python development framework based on the spaCy platform. The languages currently supported are German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish.

### Vocabulary Annotation Tool&#x20;

The Vocabulary Annotation Tool (VAT) is a Python application to locate and tag vocabulary terms within free text and to output suggested subject annotations in a range of formats. The tool currently works on English language texts. Vocabularies configured to date include UK FISH vocabularies and the Getty AAT.

### STELETO data conversion tool&#x20;

STELETO is a streamlined version of the original STELLAR project application for text data conversion Converts input data to any textual output format via a custom (user-defined) textual template. It has been used for conversion of datasets expressed as delimited text or JSON and for conversion of vocabulary test files to SKOS RDF.
