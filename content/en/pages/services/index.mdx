**The ATRIUM project promotes a comprehensive set of services & tools designed to support all the stages in the digitally enabled data-driven research in the Arts and Humanities.

## Discover the ATRIUM Catalogue on SSH Open Marketplace

Our list of tools and services is hosted on the SSH Open Marketplace, a comprehensive discovery portal that collects and contextualizes resources for Arts and Humanities research communities. By clicking on the titles of the tools and services, you will be taken directly to their entries on the SSH Open Marketplace where you can further explore detailed information, training materials, datasets, publications, and workflows associated with each tool. The platform not only helps you find what you need but also connects you with related publications and case studies, providing valuable context and experimenting practical applications to improve your research.

You can also explore the full list of tools and services of the ATRIUM catalogue on the SSH Open Marketplace, by simply entering the keyword "ATRIUM catalogue" into the search box on the homepage. This search will direct you to the complete list of tools and services, as well as workflows created using them.

#### Selection Criteria

The ATRIUM catalogue includes tools, services and workflows developed or used by partners in the ATRIUM project, provided they are included in the SSH Open Marketplace, have sufficient metadata and are publicly accessible. If the last three criteria are only partially met, the project offers support to help partners achieve compliance, such as expansion into the SSH Open Marketplace. 

Tools developed by ATRIUM partners, even if not directly used in the project, may be considered if they align with the ATRIUM context and purpose.
