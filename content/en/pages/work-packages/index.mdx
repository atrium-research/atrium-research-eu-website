## Work Package 3: Facilitating Discoverability of and Access to Humanities Resources

Lead: OEAW\
Contact: Matej Ďurco & Massimiliano Carloni \
Duration: January 2024 – December 2026

WP3 aims to enable researchers (and the wider public) to easily find, access and reuse resources in the Arts and Humanities (such as datasets, services, publications etc.). This objective aligns with the FAIR principles and can be approached through analysis and action on at least three levels: (1) the quality of the resources' metadata (e.g. its completeness and consistency); (2) the data formats of the resources and the models according to which their metadata are expressed; (3) the data catalogues themselves, with their characteristics, underlying semantic artefacts and curation pipelines. While each task of WP3 focuses on one level of analysis, the tasks collaborate with each other, aided by the use of common data models (based on Linked Open Data standards) that allow easy exchange of information.

For an overview of the ATRIUM services and tools, please see the [dedicated catalogue](https://atrium-research.eu/services/).

### Objectives:

* **Task 3.1 ‘Semantic interoperability’** fosters semantic interoperability through the harmonisation of models, schemas, vocabularies and ontologies. This also ensures the availability of resources (data and tools) to the research workflows and improves permeability of data between services for hosting, processing and visualising.
* **Task 3.2 ‘Metadata harmonisation and enrichment’** improves the findability and discoverability of resources by enhancing metadata quality in the catalogues of the research infrastructures participating in ATRIUM. This will also involve analysis of the wider repository landscape in terms of resource coverage and curation pipelines, including catalogues such as Europeana and OpenAIRE.
* **Task 3.3 ‘Fostering data interoperability through use of standards’** makes data available in standard formats and models to make them more readily available for use and processing by other applications in new research contexts. 
* **Task 3.4 ‘Multilinguality’** improves the discoverability of resources by translating both metadata (especially keywords) and data (in particular the textual content of resources) to support a wide range of languages and automated processing tools.

#### Related to: 

* WP3’s focus on interoperability for data, metadata and semantics collaborates with WP6’s focus on service interoperability.
* The improved interoperability and findability in WP3 will support the workflows in WP4, as WP4 will link datasets and chains of tools and services in workflows. Consequently, the workflow-based demonstrators developed in WP5 will also benefit from the work of WP3.

## Work Package 4: Providing Enhanced Workflows for Frontier Research in the Humanities

Lead: DARIAH\
Contact: Anne Baillot\
Duration: January 2024 – April 2027

Workflows are key to research processes, yet they lack appropriate recognition. So that researchers can best apply digital methods to their work, WP4 will create and disseminate reusable workflows. These step-by-step guides describe how to perform a task within the research data lifecycle by combining digital tools, datasets and methods into meaningful and reproducible research processes. ATRIUM workflow descriptions will be hosted on the [SSH Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/) and aggregated to the [Workflow Catalogue on the website](https://atrium-research.eu/workflows/). &#x20;

### Objectives:

* **Task 4.1 Text-Based Workflows** enable researchers to extract and process textual content from scanned documents and manuscripts through common OCR/HTR tools. 
* **Task 4.2 Image-Based Workflows** improve access to images by integrating visual data into platforms for critical editions and catalogues through tools such as IIIF. 
* **Task 4.3 3D-Based Workflows** enhance the capabilities of 3D data presentation, including interactive tools for heritage studies such as 3DHOP and Heritage BIM. 
* **Task 4.4 Sound-Based Workflows** focus on the automatic transcription and information extraction of audio field notes from archaeological sites. This workflow supports oral history projects and fieldwork documentation.
* **Task 4.5 Geospatial Workflows** leverage tools like Recogito to annotate maps collaboratively, enriching metadata, enabling geospatial analyses and linking locations to gazetteers for interdisciplinary research.

#### Related to:

* The demonstrators in WP5 will test the workflow pipelines from WP4.
* The workflows from WP4 will support the creation of an open peer review assessment for workflows in Task 7.4. 
* The workflows will link a chain of tools and services, drawing on the improved  interoperability from WP3 (data/metadata) and WP6 (service interoperability).

## Work Package 5: Curiosity-driven Demonstrators 

Lead: University of York, Archaeology Data Service\
Contact: Julian Richards & Émilie Page-Perron\
Duration: January 2024 – September 2027

In order to bring the workflows in WP4 to life, the demonstrators in WP5 will provide real-life examples using archaeological data. These demonstrators showcase how advanced workflows and technologies can address challenges in digitizing, analyzing, and interpreting complex datasets, of which the metadata will be aggregated into the[ ARIADNE portal.](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/) 

### Objectives:

* **Task 5.1** **Text-Based Demonstrators** will show the potential of image segmentation, text recognition, named entity recognition, and entity linking on articles, archaeological fieldwork reports and context sheets in English and Czech. The enriched metadata will also be extended into knowledge graphs for research.
* **Task 5.2 Image-Based Demonstrators** will allow researchers to annotate image data sets from different sources and websites. Leveraging the  IIIF framework, images that were previously distributed across museums, galleries and archives across Europe can be brought together for the first time. For example, through Rock Art and sculpture case studies, researchers can compare motifs in early medieval sculpture with those found on illuminated manuscripts of the same period. 
* **Task 5.3 3D-Based Demonstrators** implement 3D viewers in the ARIADNE portal and at providers’ repositories to showcase a research environment combining aggregated datasets from various sources. This allows a multi-disciplinary 3D rendering of built heritage sites, such as the endangered site of the Kampanopetra basilica in Cyprus.
* **Task 5.4 Sound-Based Demonstrators** develop a tool and application to automatically transcribe archaeological field note recordings to aid in completing context sheets. The context sheets’ metadata can then easily be enriched with information from those fields. 
* **Task 5.5 Geospatial Demonstrators** annotate historical maps such as the Charta of Greece and maps of Serbia to generate geo-located lists of places for reuse. Place is used to connect multiple disciplines by georeferencing historical data. For example, historical data regarding population, land ownership and agriculture is plotted on maps of Sweden from 1570–1810. 

#### Related to: 

* WP5 is closely related to WP4, as it provides tests for the workflows and integrated services developed in WP4. 
* The demonstrators in WP5 also take into account the new audiences explored in WP2. 
* The sound-based data developed in T5.4 is also related to the oral history portal in T6.4. 

## Work Package 6: Service Interoperability and EOSC Integration 

Lead: CLARIN\
Contact: Dieter Van Uytvanck\
Duration: January 2024 – June 2027

### Objectives:

* **Task 6.1 Service interoperability enhances interoperability** between services of the ATRIUM portfolio by inventing repository-specific APIs (e.g. the Archeology Data Service and the GoTriple platform) and registering these in the Digital Object Gateway (DOG).
* **Task 6.2 Connect national repositories to Episciences** connects repositories from the ATRIUM portfolio of services with the innovative Diamond Open Access scientific publishing platform Episciences.org.
* **Task 6.3 EOSC community integration and evaluation** establishes a community-centred testing space for EOSC services and integration. 
* **Task 6.4 Connecting the oral history transcription portal to the EOSC** improves an existing oral history transcription portal by connecting it to the EOSC. This upgrade will enhance the portal’s automatic speech recognition capabilities, making it a valuable tool for researchers working with spoken data.

#### Related to:

* Service interoperability is closely working with WP3 focusing on semantic, metadata and data interoperability.
* WP6 will integrate the results from WP4 & WP5.
* Task 6.4 is related to 4.4 and 5.4. 

## Work Package 7: Fostering Cross-Disciplinary Research through Training and Open Science

Lead: OPERAS\
Contact: Carol Delmazo \
Duration: January 2024 – December 2027

### Objectives:

* **Task 7.1 The ATRIUM Skillset Assessment** assesses the skills required by the Arts and Humanities community for the active use of services provided by ATRIUM Research Infrastructures and the researchers’ training needs. Based on this assessment, a set of recommendations will be provided for the ATRIUM Curriculum (Task 7.3), with particular attention to the issues of the digital gap. 
* **Task 7.2: The ATRIUM Bridge** connects end-users (researchers) and both service and data providers, contributing to service improvement. This involves mainly two workshop formats, the ‘Researcher Forum’, fostering closer interactions between researchers and research infrastructures, and the ‘Mutual Learning Exercise’, addressing (meta)data interoperability and quality challenges impacting dissemination and reuse of research outputs.
* **Task 7.3 The ATRIUM Curriculum** develops an integrated and comprehensive set of courses hosted on [DARIAH-Campus](https://campus.dariah.eu/), articulating training materials into online course curricula and coordinating both formal and informal training.
* **Task 7.4 The ATRIUM Peer Review Framework** creates a robust framework for open peer review assessment of different research outputs (data papers, training materials, workflows and others). This aims to counter the bias in academia that privileges certain types of research outputs like journal articles. 

#### Related to:

* Closely working with WP2 for training events.
* T7.4 related with WP4 ‘workflows’.

## Work Package 8: Transnational Access 

Lead: University of York, Archaeology Data Service\
Contact: Nicky Garland\
Duration: January 2024 – December 2027

WP8 manages opportunities for Arts and Humanities researchers to undertake Transnational Access placements at ATRIUM-funded institutions. ATRIUM’s Transnational Access (TNA) scheme offers researchers the possibility to apply for a fully funded placement at 16 Digital Humanities & Data Management organisations across Europe.
