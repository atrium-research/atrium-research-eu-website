summary: Digital Research Infrastructure for the Humanities (eHum PSNC)
---
**Location:** Pozna≈Ñ, Poland

**Contact:** Arek Margraf ([margraf@man.poznan.pl](mailto:margraf@man.poznan.pl))

The scope of the e-infrastructure is in three main areas:

1. **Data Collection and Storage**

We offer support in building and maintaining repositories, libraries and other digital
platforms that serve research teams to efficiently collect and store research data for the
purposes of humanities projects in the long term.

1. **Data Processing, Analysis and Visualisation**

We develop dedicated tools for data processing and analysis, necessary for working with larger
amounts of source material. We also help you select existing digital tools to meet your
research goals, and if necessary, we can adapt them to your specific needs.

1. **Sharing and Promotion of Results**

We build and maintain web services to promote information on the progress of research
projects. We create portals to share project results materials, combining functions of
effective data presentation with research tools and open APIs.

## Services currently offered by the infrastructure

* **HTR and OCR services** come with unique and supplementary features, such as file conversion,
  the ability to recognize aged prints, and the capability to train models for unconventional
  handwritten characters like musical notation. The HTR system is built upon KRAKEN/eScriptorium
  and operates on a high-speed CPU/GPU with ample storage for data.
* **Virtual Transcription Laboratory Service** for collective transcription of historical printed
  documents, with built-in OCR, correction and training functions for old prints and import of
  content from digital libraries.
* **Aggregation Services** (Digital Libraries Federation & Europeana). Find out more about
  collections of Polish and European cultural and scientific institutions by exploring FBC
  (Digital Libraries Federation) and Europeana. These portals give access to over 50 million
  digitised items and are being visited by millions of international visitors.
* **Locloud Collections Cloud service** of creating digital libraries, archives and
  museums dedicated to small cultural institutions and research teams.
* **Plain Letter Platform** is an online platform intended as a database of official letters and a
  tool for simplifying their linguistic layer. The service implements the EU directive on the
  accessibility of digital tools in terms of improving the communicative accessibility of writings
  for recipients. For this purpose, it uses models from the area of natural language processing
  (such as NER) as well as large transformer language models (for example, BART) trained on
  datasets collected at PSNC (mainly in Polish).
* **Digitization Laboratory** to practice object digitization using PSNC's fast-scanning and large
  object-scanning scanners, cameras in the photo studio and 3D-scanners. Our team will provide
  expertise on choosing digitization methods, colour management and measurement (delta E).
* PSNC can provide support and expertise based on its Digital Libraries and Knowledge Platforms
  department that works on ICT solutions for cultural heritage and digital humanities. The team is
  composed of 35+ members with expertise in ICT research & development, including cloud computing,
  large-scale processing of data, data aggregation and management, data normalisation and
  conversion, text processing, digitization workflows as well as dedicated solutions for digital
  humanities.
