**Location:** Sheffield, United Kingdom

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at USFD is one of the largest and most successful
research groups in text mining and natural language processing in the EU. USFD develops and
maintains the world leading open-source GATE text mining and natural language processing
infrastructure (see [link here](https://cloud.gate.ac.uk)) and its vibrant user community. The GATE
NLP services are already serving users from CLARIN (through CLARIN UK), the SoBigData++ research
infrastructure, and the European Language Grid (ELG). The GATE infrastructure has hundreds of users,
with the community growing annually through summer schools, online training materials, and take up
via CLARIN, SoBigData++, and ELG. We have experience with hosting TNA visits, since USFD manages TNA
access for the SoBigData++ infrastructure, as well as hosts SoBigData++ TNA visits annually.

## Services currently offered by the infrastructure

The GATE/CLARIN UK infrastructure already provides not only general purpose NLP services such as
named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, but also services specifically tailored to the
domain of archeology. These include English, Dutch, and Swedish Archeology and Dendrochronology
Named Entity Recognisers. The archeology-specific services being offered will grow during the
project itself (see WP4). In the past 5 years alone, GATE has underpinned over 15 European projects.
We also offer access to state-of-the art HPC and Hadoop computer clusters for running text mining
experiments, as well as access to numerous linguistic resources and datasets that can be used to
train and adapt language models and carry out machine learning experiments.

## What this TNA offers

USFD will offer access to tools, models and resources such as datasets, in the area of use and
adaptation of language technologies. They will provide mentors to guide the application and
adaptation of tools and resources to archaeological data in research visitors' use cases.

The GATE/CLARIN UK research infrastructure represented by USFD offers to host up to 12 person weeks
a year in the area of use and adaptation of language technologies, such as language analysis
(including named entity recognition and terminology extraction), machine translation, and
multilingual adaptation of NLP models and tools. Partners from USFD will collaborate to guide the
application of the above-mentioned methods to archaeological data in research visitors' use cases
and will be able to provide multilingual datasets for NLP. Mentors will be available to the hosted
researchers to explain the issues and guide the visitors while working on their own research
problems in these areas. Researchers hosted by the RI will get workspace, access to its computing
resources and all data and software in the RI's repository, as well as the web services that the RI
offers.
