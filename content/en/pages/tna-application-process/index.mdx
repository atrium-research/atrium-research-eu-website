## Evaluation criteria

Once applications have been submitted and reviewed by host organisations for eligibility, all applications to the TNA scheme will be assessed by the TNA Program Committee. The members of the Committee are international experts in archaeological research and includes members of ATRIUM organisations and those who are independent of the project. A minimum of three members of the committee will assess each application.

Applications will be assessed and ranked on the basis of four criteria:

* quality of the research idea (individual access only).
* quality of the implementation plan (individual access only).
* quality of fit between the applicant and the proposed host.
* impact on the applicant's research to their home institution or community.

On request, unsuccessful applicants wishing to re-apply may receive feedback on their application.

We ask all applicants to Individual Access to please contact their proposed host organisation in advance of their application to discuss their project and ascertain the suitability of the host organisation to provide support.

Applicants will be informed of the outcome of their application within six months of the submission of their application via the online form.

ATRIUM will take all measures to ensure impartial and objective implementation of the TNA scheme and reduce the prospect that the application process is compromised for reasons involving economic interest, political or national affinity, family or emotional ties or any other shared interest ('conflict of interests'). Any potential Program Committee members who feel they have a conflict of interest will be asked to recuse themselves from the selection process. In cases where applicants would receive the same weighted score, scholars from regions and communities with less training and education opportunities will be given preference.

The ATRIUM project will provide equal opportunities with regards to Transnational Access. While the selection process will be based solely on the scientific merit, we will collect demographic information for applicants for each call and, if required, adjust the target audience to address imbalances in gender, geographical location or the participation of early career researchers.
