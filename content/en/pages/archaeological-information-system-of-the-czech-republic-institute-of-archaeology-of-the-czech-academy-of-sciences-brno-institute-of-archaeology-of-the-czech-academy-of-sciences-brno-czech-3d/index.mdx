AIS CR serves as a central public service dedicated to securely managing archaeological data at the national level in the Czech Republic. It actively promotes the dissemination, synergistic utilisation, and accessibility of this data for both scientific and general purposes. By integrating various components of the archaeological information collection and distribution process, AIS CR addresses legal aspects related to fieldwork, supports education, and manages the preservation and availability of primary research data. These records are crucial as they represent the sole remaining documentation of archaeological contexts, many of which have been irreversibly impacted by construction activities. The main objective is to implement a universal information system within the practices of archaeological institutions, enrich it with additional data and facilitate its integration with other sources. Currently, AMCR contains essential information on all planned, ongoing, and completed fieldwork in the Czech Republic, along with their outcomes. AIS CR has established a dedicated team of data experts advocating for substantial changes in archaeological research approaches and archive management. Their efforts have significantly contributed to increasing the accessibility of Czech archaeological data through an open access regime. Furthermore, AIS CR actively participates in international research projects and initiatives, fostering data integration, promoting sharing standards, eliminating barriers to international data use, and disseminating best practices based on FAIR data principles in archaeological data archiving.

## What this TNA offers

Join us for an intensive one-week summer school at the Institute of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, where you will learn how to create 3D models of archaeological artefacts and historic monuments through photogrammetry and laser scanning, as well as how to process and manage them. The technologies for 3D documentation are becoming increasingly prevalent in archaeological research and monument protection. These techniques not only serve to preserve archaeological heritage in the form of a digital twin, they are also very well suited for example for popularisation purposes. Our schedule combines engaging theoretical lectures with practical workshops, ensuring you gain both essential knowledge and real-world experience. We are excited to assist you in mastering cutting-edge techniques that will enhance your archaeological research and practice! The summer school is ideal for beginners, offering introductory courses and hands-on learning opportunities to help participants gain confidence in the subject.

## Services currently offered by the infrastructure

AIS CR is an umbrella platform encompassing tools and services designed for recording and managing archaeological fieldwork. It facilitates the publication of fieldwork-related data and documents, and offers a formal framework for citizen science operations and result recording. Additionally, AIS CR supports education, promotes data sharing, and advocates for best practices in the discipline. This unique set of services and information provided by AIS CR is valuable for research, teaching historical fields, and heritage care. It grants access to cultural heritage for conservation and tourism, aids in land-use planning, reduces costs associated with construction and industrial interventions, and advances digital humanities technologies. AIS CR offers linked and accessible information on archaeological heritage and the historical landscape, contributing to the formation of cultural identity. Centralised collection and provision of information on archaeological projects, fieldworks, and sites, including project documentation, fieldwork reports, photographs, maps, plans, and expert reports, empower public administration bodies and professional archaeologists to fulfil their obligations under the State Heritage Care Act.

AIS CR also assists development companies and investors in planning and assessing risks in areas of interest. The AIS CR team provides training and lectures to the archaeological community, the citizen science community and the public, and offers expertise in archival processing of documents and in data stewardship in general.
