# atrium website

project website for the atrium project. deployed at<https://atrium-research.eu>.

## how to run

prerequisites:

- [node.js 22.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm 9.x](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> [!TIP]
>
> you can use `pnpm` to install the required node.js version with `pnpm env use 22 --global`

set required environment variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

also, set environment variables required by [validation](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) and
[deployment](./.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml) github actions. use
["variables"](https://github.com/atrium-research/atrium-research-eu-website/settings/variables/actions)
for every environment variable prefixed with `PUBLIC_`, and
["secrets"](https://github.com/atrium-research/atrium-research-eu-website/settings/secrets/actions)
for all others.

the default template accepts the following variables:

- `PUBLIC_REDMINE_ID` (required): service issue for this application in the acdh-ch
  [redmine](https://redmine.acdh.oeaw.ac.at) issue tracker.
- `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` (required): the base url for this application. the default of
  "http://localhost:3000" should be fine for local development.
- `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_PATH` (optional): set this when deploying to a path other than "/".
- `PUBLIC_BOTS` (required): whether this website can be indexed by web crawlers like the google bot.
  supported values are "disabled" and "enabled", defaults to "disabled".
- `PUBLIC_MATOMO_BASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_MATOMO_ID` (optional): set these to support client-side
  analytics with matomo.
- `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` (optional): set this to verify site ownership for google search
  console.
- `ENV_VALIDATION` (optional): whether environment variables should be validated. supported values
  are "disabled", "enabled" and "public" (only validate public variables, which can be useful in a
  docker build context to avoid having to pass secrets to `docker build`), defaults to "enabled".

when adding new environment variables, don't forget to add them to `.env.local.example` as well.

install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

run a development server on <http://localhost:3000>:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> [!TIP]
>
> this template supports developing in containers. when opening the project in your editor, you
> should be prompted to re-open it in a devcontainer.

## how to edit content

use the admin ui at <http://localhost:3000/admin> when developing locally (this will save changes to
the filesystem), or at <https://atrium-research.eu/admin> (this will commit changes to the github
repository).

## how to deploy

- ask a sysadmin to create a new acdh-ch kubernetes project.
- create a new namespace in that project via [rancher](https://rancher.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at), and set
  the `KUBE_NAMESPACE` github variable to that namespace.
- adjust the [`app_name`](./.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml#L36), which will be the name of the
  deployment in the above namespace.
- set the `PUBLIC_URL` github variable to the application's public url (e.g.
  "https://my-app.acdh-ch-dev.oeaw.ac.at"), and set the `KUBE_INGRESS_BASE_DOMAIN` to the public
  url's base domain (e.g. "acdh-ch-dev.oeaw.ac.at"). `PUBLIC_URL` should match
  `PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL`.
- when deploying to a production domain (i.e. a domain not ending in "acdh-ch-dev.oeaw.ac.at"), set
  `HELM_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS` to
  `--set 'ingress.annotations.cert-manager\.io/cluster-issuer=acdh-prod'` for "acdh.oeaw.ac.at"
  domains, or to `--set 'ingress.annotations.cert-manager\.io/cluster-issuer=letsencrypt-prod'` for
  any other non-oeaw domains, and ensure `KUBE_INGRESS_BASE_DOMAIN` is set correctly.
- if you haven't yet, create a service issue in the acdh-ch
  [redmine](https://redmine.acdh.oeaw.ac.at) issue tracker, and set the `SERVICE_ID` github variable
  to the issue number. this should match the `PUBLIC_REDMINE_ID` variable in your `.env.local` file.
- ensure required build args (prefixed with `PUBLIC_`) are referenced in both the
  [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile), as well as the [validation](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) and
  [deployment](./.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml) pipelines, and set as
  [github variables](https://github.com/atrium-research/atrium-research-eu-website/settings/variables/actions).
- ensure required runtime environment variables are referenced in the
  [validation](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) and
  [deployment](./.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml) pipelines, and set as
  [github secrets](https://github.com/atrium-research/atrium-research-eu-website/settings/secrets/actions).
  github secrets need to be prefixed with `K8S_SECRET_` to be automatically copied to the runtime
  environment. in case you need secrets in the docker build context, you can
  [mount a secret in the Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/).
- ensure both the github repository, as well as the
  [package registry](https://github.com/orgs/acdh-oeaw/packages/container/my-app/settings) is set to
  public.
- the `PUBLIC_BOTS` variable defaults to "disabled", which signals to web crawlers that the website
  should not be indexed. when deploying to a production domain (i.e. a domain not ending in
  "acdh-ch-dev.oeaw.ac.at") this should be set to "enabled".

if everything is set up correctly, every git push to the `main` branch will create a new deployment
if the validation pipeline passes.

you can reference the [template repository](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/template-website-astro) for
a working setup.

> [!NOTE]
>
> by default, this will deploy a `node` server, which will serve pre-rendered pages, assets, and api
> routes. if you prefer a truly static build, which uses `caddy` as a fileserver, use the
> `Dockerfile.static` instead, and remove `output: "hybrid"` from `astro.config.ts`. you will also
> need to change the `generate:search-index` script to `pagefind --site ./dist/`.
